Professor Punctual´s rheumatism necessitates for him to spend some weeks at a spa just across the border. His wife can´t come because of the kids so she takes care packing his suitcase, knowing his meticulousness. Meanwhile, he tidies up his study, has the maid swear several times that she won´t touch anything and drops in on his wife for a moment: &quot;Please think of packing this box of cigars. I will have to declare it at customs, but you know I don´t smoke another brand, I´d rather pay more for something I like.&quot; She takes the box and he leaves.

Finally, he sets off. He takes the train and arrives at the border. There is a lot going on at the customs office, many people try to sneak something past the officers. But the Professor is confident and steps up, opens his suitcase and shows the cigar box on top. 
&quot;Anything to declare?&quot;
&quot;Yes, Sir, these cigars.&quot;
The officer is puzzled by this frankness and becomes suspicious. &quot;And nothing else?&quot;
&quot;Nothing!&quot; the Professor smiles innocently. - &quot;Nothing at all?&quot; 
&quot;Please, Sir: see for yourself.&quot;
The officer checks the suitcase. The Professor smiles. People around them start noticing and watching. And then - a triumphant cry from the officer, a dismayed sound from the Professor: the officer presents a second cigar box!
People start murmuring. &quot;What a hypocrite!&quot; &quot;And he looked so innocent!&quot; 
The Professor is fined a lot, both customs and a high penalty, is lectured at and misses his train. 
Finally, late at night, he arrives at his destination, completely exhausted. He checks the ransacked luggage for soap, a comb, brush and so on - and then he notices a telegram on the table. It´s from his wife. &quot;Hope you arrived safely. Forgot to tell you. Your washing things are in the second cigar box.&quot;"
