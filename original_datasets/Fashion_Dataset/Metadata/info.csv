We were fooled by the very bright sunshine into believing summer had come early to the Kent Coast but, boy, were we wrong. Even in the early afternoon my fingers were frozen trying to operate the camera but once the Sun dipped behind the buildings it got bitter very quickly.
   Button had been his usual lively self until he started shivering so we returned to the car to have some coffee and a bite to eat but, even so, he didn't seem keen to continue his exploration of the beach and town. I thought he might be alright in the rucksack so we gave it a go. You might think I took this picture because it is quite cute but, in reality, I took it to prove to Esther than Button was absolutely fine where he was. He continued happily on Esther's back for the next half hour while she roved around the town searching for Fish &amp; Chips for supper. No joy so we settled for a Big Mac at the Services on the M25 on the way home.","false","false","false","true","false",19-MAR-11,22-MAR-11,22-MAR-11,,13,8,"142770cf5f","http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5059/5548513100_c6f2a20dea_o.jpg","c6f2a20dea",4

Mossèn Cinto Verdaguer

(Folgueroles, 17 de maig de 1845 – Vallvidrera, 10 de juny de 1902) és un dels més grans poetes que han donat les lletres catalanes, i el màxim exponent de la Renaixença. El bisbe Torras i Bages el va qualificar de Príncep dels poetes catalans. També es coneix Jacint Verdaguer com a Mossèn Cinto Verdaguer, pel fet de ser sacerdot.

Va ser el cinquè fill de vuit, dels quals només en sobrevisqueren tres. Als 13 anys ingressà al Seminari de Vic. En aquella època, i més en una família profundament religiosa com la de Verdaguer, era costum induir els fills a que ingressessin en l'església apostòlica, car els assegurava una professió pel futur proper. Tot i així, el 1859 s'escapà del seminari i de casa seva per fer de soldat, ja que li agradava molt l'armament militar (arreglava pistoles i fusells), però després de trobar-lo a Figueres reemprengué la seva carrera de sacerdot al seminari.

De mica en mica, el jove Verdaguer va coneixent els clàssics que li ensenyen al seminari i els escriptors del romanticisme, i al mateix temps, en part gràcies al seu amic Jaume Colell, comença a freqüentar els clubs d'altern de Vic, en especial el Cercle Lactari i les reunions dels estudiants universitaris en tornar a Vic. Mentre segueix estudiant, i fent de mestre i de pagès, comença a escriure nombrosos poemes, així com a recollir cançons populars. D'aquesta època en queden els poemes amb un component amorós més marcat, de fet no foren publicats fins el 1925, 23 anys després de la seva mort sota el títol de Jovenívoles. El mateix Verdaguer els amagava sota d'una biga de la seva cambra per por de què algú pogués observar-los, car no eren poemes que corresponguessin a la seva condició de capellà. El 1864 concursa per primera vegada als Jocs Florals, però passa totalment desapercebut. En canvi, l'any següent, torna a participar en els Jocs Florals de Barcelona amb quatre composicions, i dues d'elles són premiades. En anar a recollir els premis començà la llegenda del jove poeta, car es presentà vestit amb la indumentària típica de la pagesia: roba de pana i barretina vermella. És segurament aquesta imatge la que ha esdevingut més simptomàtica d'ell, car representava la noblesa i la capacitat cultural del poble català, en especial en el món rural; dos dels pilars bàsics del moviment ideològic de la Renaixença. És també en aquesta època quan es produeix un endarreriment en els seus estudis, suspenent Teologia al Seminari. L'any següent torna a guanyar dos premis en els mateixos Jocs Florals.

El 24 de setembre de 1870 és ordenat sacerdot a Vic i l'octubre d'aquell mateix any, canta la seva primera missa a l'ermita de Sant Jordi. Als 28 anys entra de capellà a la Companyia Transatlàntica perquè li havien recomanat per a la seva salut el clima marítim i l'any següent embarca a Cadis rumb a l'Havana. Finalment s'estableix a Barcelona, com a capellà de la família del marquès de Comillas, amo de la companyia. Als 32 anys, el jurat dels Jocs Florals li concedeix el premi extraordinari de la Diputació de Barcelona pel poema L'Atlàntida. És la consagració de Verdaguer com a poeta.

L'any 1880, per haver guanyat tres premis als Jocs Florals, és proclamat Mestre en Gai Saber. Aquest mateix any publica el llibre Montserrat. Als 39 anys viatja a París, Suïssa, Alemanya i Rússia. El 21 de març de 1886, als 41 anys, el bisbe Morgades el corona com a Poeta de Catalunya al Monestir de Ripoll. Publica el gran poema Canigó al 1885 i realitza un viatge de peregrinació a Terra Santa.

És després d'aquest viatge que atura la seva producció literària i es dedica a altres activitats poc ortodoxes, una de les quals és la pràctica d'exorcismes. Sovint s'ha comentat que a part de l'exercici d'exorcismes, activitats que són conegudes per haver-se'n guardat textos sobre ells, també hi havia una animadversió cap a les activitats del marquès de Comillas.

El mateix Verdaguer els amagava sota d'una biga de la seva cambra per por de què algú pogués observar-los, car no eren poemes que corresponguessin a la seva condició de capellà. El 1864 concursa per primera vegada als Jocs Florals, però passa totalment desapercebut. En canvi, l'any següent, torna a participar en els Jocs Florals de Barcelona amb quatre composicions, i dues d'elles són premiades. En anar a recollir els premis començà la llegenda del jove poeta, car es presentà vestit amb la indumentària típica de la pagesia: roba de pana i barretina vermella. És segurament aquesta imatge la que ha esdevingut més simptomàtica d'ell, car representava la noblesa i la capacitat cultural del poble català, en especial en el món rural; dos dels pilars bàsics del moviment ideològic de la Renaixença. És també en aquesta època quan es produeix un endarreriment en els seus estudis, suspenent Teologia al Seminari. L'any següent torna a guanyar dos premis en els mateixos Jocs Florals.

El 24 de setembre de 1870 és ordenat sacerdot a Vic i l'octubre d'aquell mateix any, canta la seva primera missa a l'ermita de Sant Jordi. Als 28 anys entra de capellà a la Companyia Transatlàntica perquè li havien recomanat per a la seva salut el clima marítim i l'any següent embarca a Cadis rumb a l'Havana. Finalment s'estableix a Barcelona, com a capellà de la família del marquès de Comillas, amo de la companyia. Als 32 anys, el jurat dels Jocs Florals li concedeix el premi extraordinari de la Diputació de Barcelona pel poema L'Atlàntida. És la consagració de Verdaguer com a poeta.

L'any 1880, per haver guanyat tres premis als Jocs Florals, és proclamat Mestre en Gai Saber. Aquest mateix any publica el llibre Montserrat. Als 39 anys viatja a París, Suïssa, Alemanya i Rússia. El 21 de març de 1886, als 41 anys, el bisbe Morgades el corona com a Poeta de Catalunya al Monestir de Ripoll. Publica el gran poema Canigó al 1885 i realitza un viatge de peregrinació a Terra Santa.

És després d'aquest viatge que atura la seva producció literària i es dedica a altres activitats poc ortodoxes, una de les quals és la pràctica d'exorcismes. Sovint s'ha comentat que a part de l'exercici d'exorcismes, activitats que són conegudes per haver-se'n guardat textos sobre ells, també hi havia una animadversió cap a les activitats del marquès d...","false","false","false","true","false",15-MAY-09,25-JAN-11,18-MAY-09,,29,0,"0a4da6836c","http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3633/3542831607_01bdd683dc_o.jpg","01bdd683dc",4

De Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre


Un caganer es una figura de una persona defecando que se suele colocar en los belenes, como tradición en Cataluña y en la Comunidad Valenciana. También es frecuente esta figura en los belenes de las islas Canarias como puede verse en un belén de Tazacorte, isla de La Palma. En otros puntos de la Península Ibérica, Portugal y Región de Murcia, existen los personajes belenísticos semejantes del cagador y cagón respectivamente.

Se cree que el origen de esta tradición se sitúa en el siglo XVIII. Tradicionalmente, el caganer era un campesino ataviado con la indumentaria tradicional catalana (faja y barretina). Más modernamente se han realizado todo tipo de versiones del caganer, utilizando a menudo la imagen de personajes populares como políticos o deportistas.

Generalmente, esta figura se sitúa en un rincón apartado del belén, intentando que no quede en un lugar destacado. Aunque no se conoce con exactitud cual es la razón para colocar una figura defecando, se cree que el caganer con sus heces fertiliza la Tierra, por lo que se le considera un símbolo de prosperidad y buena suerte para el año siguiente. La tradición del caganer está aceptada plenamente por la Iglesia.

La gente decía que con sus heces abonaba la tierra y así la fertilizaba para el año siguiente. Con él había la salud y tranquilidad de cuerpo y alma que hace falta para montar el pesebre, con el gozo y alegría que comporta la Navidad en el hogar. Colocar esta figura en el Belén, traía suerte y alegría; no hacerlo comportaba desventura.

Últimamente se venden en el comercio figuras de caganers con imágenes de personajes famosos. Por ejemplo, en el año 2008 se vendían figuras de Barack Obama, Hugo Chávez, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner y Lula da Silva.[1]

Curiosamente, el caganer no es el único personaje navideño típicamente catalán que defeca. Existe otra tradición, el Tió, un tronco de árbol al que los niños sacuden la noche antes de Navidad. Al ritmo de los golpes y de la canción que los niños le dedican el Tió les recompensa &quot;evacuando&quot; dulces y golosinas.","false","false","false","true","false",05-DEC-10,29-MAY-11,05-DEC-10,,3,4,"cb2033cca9","http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5008/5235699354_871ea27b4a_o.jpg","871ea27b4a",4

This photo is in the F. Oswald Barnett Collection. The photographs in the F. Oswald Barnett Collection were taken by Barnett and other unidentified photographers in the 1930s. Many of them were used to illustrate a government report on slum housing and/or made into lantern slides for lectures in a public campaign.

F. Oswald Barnett was born in Brunswick, Victoria. A committed Methodist and housing reformer, he led a crusade against Melbourne's inner city slums. In 1936 he was appointed to the Slum Abolition Board and from 1938-1948 he was the vice-chair of the Housing Commission. In this position he attempted to shape compassionate public housing policy. He later protested vigorously against proposed high-rise housing.

"7314422050","Buckskin Gulch, Utah By Phil Konstantin","http://www.flickr.com/photos/36205567@N07/7314422050/","36205567@N07","Buckskin Gulch Utah. Note the log 40 feet in the air.  The Buckskin Gulch, a canyon in southern Utah, is one of the main tributaries of the Paria River, which is itself a minor tributary of the Colorado River. It is the longest and deepest slot canyon in the southwest United States and may very well be the longest in the world. As such it is one of the premier destinations for slot canyon hikers, and receives a high amount of foot traffic.

At over 13 miles (21 km) in length it is often visited in conjunction with the longer Paria Canyon, although some prefer to make a long day trip out of the hike. With a distance of 20 miles (32 km), hiking this canyon in one day is possible but not easy. Wire Pass, a short tributary to the Buckskin, is an ideal alternative for a short day hike that still takes hikers through the narrow, curving features that are the hallmark of slot canyons.

This photo is in the F. Oswald Barnett Collection. The photographs in the F. Oswald Barnett Collection were taken by Barnett and other unidentified photographers in the 1930s. Many of them were used to illustrate a government report on slum housing and/or made into lantern slides for lectures in a public campaign.

F. Oswald Barnett was born in Brunswick, Victoria. A committed Methodist and housing reformer, he led a crusade against Melbourne's inner city slums. In 1936 he was appointed to the Slum Abolition Board and from 1938-1948 he was the vice-chair of the Housing Commission. In this position he attempted to shape compassionate public housing policy. He later protested vigorously against proposed high-rise housing.

While the ancient history of the fig centers around the Mediterranean region, and it is most commonly cultivated in mild-temperate climates, it nevertheless has its place in tropical and subtropical horticulture. Botanically identified as Ficus carica L. (family Moraceae), it is unique in a genus embracing perhaps over 1,000 species, mostly giant &quot;rubber trees&quot;, and mostly tropical. It is almost universally known simply as fig, common fig, or edible fig. The name is very similar in French (figue), German (feige), Italian and Portuguese (figo). In Spanish it is higo or brevo. Haitians give it the name, figue France, to distinguish it from the small, dried bananas called &quot;figs&quot;.

Plate V: FIG, Ficus carica Description

The fig is a tree of small dimensions, 10 to 30 ft (3-9 m) high, with numerous spreading branches and a trunk rarely more than 7 in (17.5 cm) in diameter. It contains copious milky latex. The root system is typically shallow and spreading, sometimes covering 50 ft (15 m) of ground, but in permeable soil some of the roots may descend to 20 ft (6 m). The deciduous leaves are palmate, deeply divided into 3 to 7 main lobes, these more shallowly lobed and irregularly toothed on the margins. The blade is up to 10 in (25 cm) in length and width, fairly thick, rough on the upper surface, softly hairy on the underside. What is commonly accepted as a &quot;fruit&quot; is technically a synconium, that is, a fleshy, hollow receptacle with a small opening at the apex partly closed by small scales. It may be obovoid, turbinate, or pear-shaped, 1 to 4 in (2.5-10 cm) long, and varies in color from yellowish-green to coppery, bronze, or dark-purple. Tiny flowers are massed on the inside wall. In the case of the common fig discussed here, the flowers are all female and need no pollination. There are 3 other types, the ''Caprifig'' which has male and female flowers requiring visits by a tiny wasp, Blastophaga grossorum; the &quot;Smyrna&quot; fig, needing crosspollination by Caprifigs in order to develop normally; and the &quot;San Pedro&quot; fig which is intermediate, its first crop independent like the common fig, its second crop dependent on pollination. The skin of the fig is thin and tender, the fleshy wall is whitish, pale-yellow, or amber, or more or less pink, rose, red or purple; juicy and sweet when ripe, gummy with latex when unripe. Seeds may be large, medium, small or minute and range in number from 30 to 1,600 per fruit.

Origin and Distribution

The fig is believed to be indigenous to Western Asia and to have been distributed by man throughout the Mediterranean area. It has been cultivated for thousands of years, remnants of figs having been found in excavations of Neolithic sites traced to at least 5,000 B.C. As time went on, the fig-growing territory stretched from Afghanistan to southern Germany and the Canary Islands. Pliny was aware of 29 types. Figs were introduced into England some time between 1525 and 1548. It is not clear when the common fig entered China but by 1550 it was reliably reported to be in Chinese gardens. European types were taken to China, Japan, India, South Africa and Australia.

The fig is a tree of small dimensions, 10 to 30 ft (3-9 m) high, with numerous spreading branches and a trunk rarely more than 7 in (17.5 cm) in diameter. It contains copious milky latex. The root system is typically shallow and spreading, sometimes covering 50 ft (15 m) of ground, but in permeable soil some of the roots may descend to 20 ft (6 m). The deciduous leaves are palmate, deeply divided into 3 to 7 main lobes, these more shallowly lobed and irregularly toothed on the margins. The blade is up to 10 in (25 cm) in length and width, fairly thick, rough on the upper surface, softly hairy on the underside. What is commonly accepted as a &quot;fruit&quot; is technically a synconium, that is, a fleshy, hollow receptacle with a small opening at the apex partly closed by small scales. It may be obovoid, turbinate, or pear-shaped, 1 to 4 in (2.5-10 cm) long, and varies in color from yellowish-green to coppery, bronze, or dark-purple. Tiny flowers are massed on the inside wall. In the case of the common fig discussed here, the flowers are all female and need no pollination. There are 3 other types, the ''Caprifig'' which has male and female flowers requiring visits by a tiny wasp, Blastophaga grossorum; the &quot;Smyrna&quot; fig, needing crosspollination by Caprifigs in order to develop normally; and the &quot;San Pedro&quot; fig which is intermediate, its first crop independent like the common fig, its second crop dependent on pollination. The skin of the fig is thin and tender, the fleshy wall is whitish, pale-yellow, or amber, or more or less pink, rose, red or purple; juicy and sweet when ripe, gummy with latex when unripe. Seeds may be large, medium, small or minute and range in number from 30 to 1,600 per fruit.

Origin and Distribution

The fig is believed to be indigenous to Western Asia and to have been distributed by man throughout the Mediterranean area. It has been cultivated for thousands of years, remnants of figs having been found in excavations of Neolithic sites traced to at least 5,000 B.C. As time went on, the fig-growing territory stretched from Afghanistan to southern Germany and the Canary Islands. Pliny was aware of 29 types. Figs were introduced into England some time between 1525 and 1548. It is not clear when the common fig entered China but by 1550 it was reliably reported to be in Chinese gardens. European types were taken to China, Japan, India, South Africa and Australia.

The first figs in the New World were planted in Mexico in 1560. Figs were introduced into California when the San...","false","false","false","true","false",26-DEC-11,06-APR-12,26-DEC-11,,14,0,"9c1fa7a754","http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7004/6571656189_af28666a4b_o.jpg","af28666a4b",4

Taken in Charleston capital of West Virginia state, America.

Khi còn ở VietNam, tôi được biết thành phố Đà Lạt đã nhập loại Sung này trồng để làm mứt
khô và mứt nhão ( jam ), nhưng không biết đến nay việc này vẫn còn phát triển hay không . Ở Mỹ mứt Sung này rất là mắc cho dù loại khô hay loại mứt nhão . Một bich chừng 200 gram mứt khô có giá hơn 10 đô la Mỹ.

Tôi đã ăn trái Sung ngọt này từ khi còn thơ ấu, mỗi lần ba ghẻ tôi trở lại từ Mỹ đều mua Sung khô hay mứt Sung cho tôi , vừa thơm vừa ngọt tới cổ họng luôn, hơi thở cũng thơm mùi Sung giống như bạn ăn Mít hay Sầu riêng vậy . Khi nào mua được nhà tôi sẽ trồng cây Sung này.   Tôi chụp hình cây Sung này trước một ngôi nhà ở trung tâm Charleston, gần bên bệnh viện Mắt của thành phố, thuộc bang West Virginia.

I 've tasted  Ficus carica's fruits since I was a kid, every time my step-father came back VietNam from California ( America ), he used to buy dried fruits and jam bottles of Ficus carica ( which they made from ripened fruits ). The good and sweet smelt of fruits came into my heart since there , even my best step-dad was gone .....

While the ancient history of the fig centers around the Mediterranean region, and it is most commonly cultivated in mild-temperate climates, it nevertheless has its place in tropical and subtropical horticulture. Botanically identified as Ficus carica L. (family Moraceae), it is unique in a genus embracing perhaps over 1,000 species, mostly giant &quot;rubber trees&quot;, and mostly tropical. It is almost universally known simply as fig, common fig, or edible fig. The name is very similar in French (figue), German (feige), Italian and Portuguese (figo). In Spanish it is higo or brevo. Haitians give it the name, figue France, to distinguish it from the small, dried bananas called &quot;figs&quot;.

Some memory jars may have come from African American traditions of decorating graves with objects owned by the deceased. The objects embedded in the surface of these bottles and jars provide clues about when they were made or who made them. For example, Jug with Finial includes a campaign button for William Jennings Bryan, a Democratic presidential candidate between 1896 and 1908, while High-Buttoned Shoe shows a macabre row of teeth that may have belonged to the maker.

"1320850615","Why is Pharoth Wearing A Foo Camp T-Shirt?  (Hint Citizen Agency)","http://www.flickr.com/photos/cambodia4kidsorg/1320850615/","58428285@N00","Donate:
<a href=""http://tinyurl.com/yq6e2s"">tinyurl.com/yq6e2s</a>

Almost 7 years ago, at age 13, Pharoth came to the gate of Roteang Orphanage crying, with her baby brother Darith in her arms. Their Mother had died and their step father had disappeared, and Pharoth was living with the baby on the earthen floor under an aunt’s house in Roteang village.

She was crying because they had no food-she was making Darith’s feeding with one scoop of formula powder to 11 ounces of water or sometimes just feeding him sugar cane sweetened water. They had no clothes. The aunt would not let her go to school, which she desperately wanted to do, as she had to  care for the baby and also work picking about 30 cents worth of morning glory daily for income for her aunt.

After negotiations with the aunt, the Sharing Foundation was allowed to admit Darith to the Orphanage and to provide clothes and supplies for Pharoth to go to the local school and a small amount of money weekly to the aunt to replace Pharoth’s earnings.  With a generous sponsor, Pharoth was able to attend an English school in Phnom Penh.

When I was invited to keynote and lead workshops at the Cambodian Bloggers Summit this summer, I collected technology and nonprofit t-shirts to bring over.  People responded so generously, that I had to pay for an extra suitcase to carry over all the t-shirts that were donated and had enough extras to bring to the children in the orphanage.

One of the most generous t-shirt donations came from Citizen Agency from Tara Hunt  and Chris Messina  packed up a big box with coveted Web2.0 t-shirts , including Tara's foo camp t-shirt that you now see Pharoh wearing.

There has already been over $20,000 for the Sharing Foundation's America's Giving Challenge raised through the unselfish giving of over 750 people like Tara Hunt and Chris Messina. If you have not yet donated $10 (or more) to this important cause, there is only 48 hours left to donate and change a Cambodian child's life!","false","false","false","true","false",28-AUG-07,29-JAN-08,04-SEP-07,,9,0,"424cbb0b2d","http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1215/1320850615_5969d145a6_o.jpg","5969d145a6",4

This is not my photograph (In my whole photo-stream, this is the only exception which is not mine). This picture was taken by photographer of Fars News Agency yesterday. It is appeared a woman who wearing Chador (black Hejab) took into a custody a lady who wearing red coat.

These days the Iranian Government, especially by the coming
of ultra conservatives like president Ahmadi Nejad and his
followers have established interest in enforcing people to
observe a Dress Code they call Islamic.

از لحظهاي كه اين عكس رو ديدم هنوز بغض دارم

علي، مرد خدا، كه چند روز ديگر را به مناسبت تولدش جشن ميگيريم چنين ميگويد:
به من خبر رسيده كه مردي از لشگر شام به خانه زن مسلمان و زني غير مسلمان كه در پناه حكومت اسلام بود وارد شد و خلخال و دستبند و گردن بند و گوشواره هاي آنها را به غارت برد در حالي كه هيچ وسيله اي براي دفاع جز گريه و التماس كردن نداشتند .
<b> اگر براي اين حادثه تلخ مسلماني از روي تاسف بميرد ملامت نخواهد شد و از نظر من سزاوار است</b> .  

From Imam Ali (1st Imam of Shias and 4th Kahlif of Sunnis):
&quot;It has come to my information that a man from the army of
Sham (enemy) has entered the home of two women that were under the
protection of an Islamic reign, one Muslim and one not.
They took their jewelery, bracelets and earrings while
they had nothing to defend themselves other than their
weeps and tears.
<b>If after this incident a Muslim dies of regret due,
in my opinion it is just</b>.&quot;

What they think of Islam? What the fuck they want from us?

Leave us alone....!
We know how we should live!
We know how we should wear!
We know how we should pray!
We know how we should be a Muslim!
Go away from &quot;our&quot; country bastard pirates!

News item from &quot;Church News,&quot; of the Episcopal Diocese of West Tennessee:

<b>Woodruff Trades Verger's Cassock for Deacon's Dalmatic, Continues Tireless Campaign against Hunger</b>

Drew Edward Woodruff was ordained into the diaconate October 28 at St. Mary's Cathedral, where he has been a member for 26 years. He will serve as a vocational deacon at the Cathedral for a period of time.

Woodruff admits to having been a &quot;C&amp;E-er&quot; (Christmas and Easter only) for his first decade as an Episcopalian.

&quot;Then about 15 years ago, our Acolyte Warden, Frank Kaiser, talked me into serving as an acolyte,&quot; Woodruff said, &quot;and three years later Bishop Stowe [then interim dean] asked me to be the verger, even though I didn't really know what that word meant at the time.&quot; He later became St. Mary's Acolyte Warden and has been active in the Verger's Guild of the Episcopal Church. His daughter, Laura Woodruff Key, is also a verger at the Cathedral.

&quot;It's where I belong,&quot; he says.

While he is well known for his liturgical service at St. Mary's, he has earned wider recognition for his deep commitment to serving the needs of the underprivileged, not only in the Cathedral's own Winchester Park neighborhood, but throughout Memphis and as far away as the Episcopal Diocese of Haiti.  He leads the Cathedral Outreach Committee's pragmatic Pop-Top Ministry, which provides ready-to-eat canned food to the underprivileged, and actively serves the Haiti Partnership, the Salvation Army Advisory Board, and Grace-St. Luke's More Than a Meal program.

Woodruff completed a Master of Arts &amp; Religion (MAR) at the Memphis Theological Seminary in 2005 and plans to resume his studies toward a Master of Divinity in 2008.

The full bodice features a circular yoke and bands of Chantilly lace, and is adorned with two silk flowers. Bands of Chantilly lace accent the three-quarter length sleeves. The gored, floor-length skirt also has bands of Chantilly lace and is trimmed with a ten-inch ruffle with velvet at the hem. The dress came from the Gus Blass Co. in Little Rock, Arkansas. The accompanying three-quarter length coat is made of black lace. It has a tubular silhouette and a jewel neckline. Scalloped lace trims the center front, hem and cuffs.
Ina McKenzie Davis, Wife of Jefferson Davis, 20th Governor (1901-1907): Mrs. Davis wore a wine red wool and velvet dress from Louisville, Kentucky, for her inaugural gown. The semi-fitted bodice resembles a vest with a rounded V opening that exposes a shirred panel of red wool. Cream colored lace makes up the mock turtleneck collar and upper portion of the bodice. Shirred red velvet comprises the belt. Red velvet and red lace ruffles trim the puffed, elbow-length sleeves. The straight, floor-length skirt features simulated box pleats.
Margaret Parkin Hadley Jones, Wife of Daniel Webster Jones, 19th Governor (1897-1901): Mrs. Jones wore a three-piece inaugural dress made of a heavy black silk taffeta. The fitted bodice features a dickey, made of shirred Chantilly lace trimmed with beading and more lace, and a lowered waistline also trimmed in beading. More beading trims the cuffs of the leg-o-mutton sleeves. The fitted bodice and the floor-length-gored skirt give an hourglass silhouette.","false","false","false","true","false",03-DEC-08,06-MAY-09,22-DEC-08,,33,0,"771ed33833","http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3205/3127555588_ee37b28693_o.jpg","ee37b28693",4

The place is vast (i.e., it covers millions of square feet!), as you will see from the facts and figures below.

Not being Muslims, our group was not allowed to enter the principal shrine that contains the tomb of Imam Reza.  And the women in our group had to don Chadors - in addition to the Islamic clothing they were already wearing - to enter the complex. Fortunately, the chadors were white and gauzy, so that lessened the burden of being so attired.

While it was disappointing not to be able to visit the shrine of the tomb of Imam Reza, we had access to almost every other part of this enormous complex.

Here, some of the central structures - a minaret and two domes - are visible through the arch in the center of the image.

Iran's Supreme Leader  Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei looks on benignly from a large poster on the right.

The main entrance to the shrine is on the left, not visible in this frame.

According to Wikipedia:

&quot;Imām Reza shrine (Persian: حرم امام رضا in Mashhad, Iran is a complex which contains the mausoleum of Imām Ridhā, the eighth Imām of Twelver Shi'ites. Also contained within the complex include: the Goharshad Mosque, a museum, a library, four seminaries, a cemetery, the Razavi University of Islamic Sciences, a dining hall for pilgrims, vast prayer halls, and other buildings.&quot;

&quot;This complex is the center of tourism in Iran, visited by 15 to 20 million pilgrims every year.&quot; 

&quot;The shrine itself covers an area of 267,079m2 while the seven courtyards which surround it cover an area of 331,578m2 - totaling 598,657 m2 (6,443,890 sq ft).&quot;

&quot;In 818 Imam Reza was allegedly martyred by Al-Ma'mun and was buried beside the grave of Harun. After this event this place was called as Mashhad al-Rida (the place of martyrdom of Ali al-Rida). Shias and sunnis started visiting there for pilgrimage of his grave. By the end of the 9th century a dome was built on the grave and many buildings and Bazaars sprang up around it. During more than a millennium it has been devastated and reconstructed several times.&quot; 

/  /  /  /

&quot;The complex contains a total of seven courtyards, which cover an area of over331,578 m2 (3,569,080 sq ft):

Sahn Inqilab - Revolution Courtyard
Sahn Azadi - Freedom Courtyard
Sahn Imam Khomeini
Sahn Gowharshad Mosque
Sahn Quds
Sahn Jumhuri Islami - Islamic Republic Courtyard
Sahn Jameh Razavi - The Razavi Grand Courtyard
Sahn Gadeer.&quot;

&quot;The courtyards also contain a total of 14 minarets, and 3 fountains.&quot;

&quot;From the courtyards, external hallways named after scholars lead to the inner areas of the mosque. They are referred to as Bast (Sanctuary), since they were meant to be a safeguard for the shrine areas:

Bast Shaykh Toosi - leads to the Central Library
Bast Shaykh Tabarsi
Bast Shaykh Hur Ameli
Bast Shaykh Baha'i&quot;

&quot;The Bast hallways lead towards a total of 21 internal halls (Riwaq) which surround the burial chamber of Ali al-Ridha. Adjacent to the burial chamber is also a mosque dating back to the 10th century known as, Bala-e-Sar Mosque.&quot;

The <b>Church of Peace</b> (German: Friedenskirche) is situated in the Marly Gardens on the Green Fence in the palace grounds of Sanssouci Park in Potsdam, Germany. The church was built according to the wishes and with the close involvement of the artistically gifted King Frederick William IV, and designed by the court architect Ludwig Persius. After Persius' death in 1845 the architect Friedrich August Stüler was tasked with continuing his work. The building work was also led by Ferdinand von Arnim and Ludwig Ferdinand Hesse. After the cornerstone was laid on 14 April 1845 the dedication of the sacred building took place on 24 September 1848. The building work lasted until 1854. The structure resembles a High Italian monastery.

The church is a columned basilica with three naves and no transcept, with a free-standing belltower. The 13.5 m high central nave overlaps the side aisles, which are half as wide. An arcade of central arches mark the crossing point. An etching of the Basilica di San Clemente in Rome made by early Christians resembles a draft design of the Potsdam church.

The religious Frederick William IV desired a flat coffered ceiling on the inside, with gold stars on a blue base painted on the panels. The king saw the design of early Christian sacred buildings, converted from market and court halls, as particularly appropriate.

An original Venetian mosaic from the early 13th century decorates the church's apse. It was originally in a church in San Capriano on Murano, Venice until its abandonment. While he was crown prince Frederick William had it bought at auction for 385 thalers and brought to Potsdam by canal.

The display shows the enthroned Christ with the Book of Life, the right hand upheld in blessing. At each side stand Mary and John the Baptist. Next to them stand the apostle Peter and Saint Cyprian, martyred by beheading in 258 and patron saint of Saint Cipriana, wearing chasubles. As an allegory for the Holy Spirit, a pigeon decorates the vertex of the hemisphere. Over the heads of the archangels Raphael and Michael a lamb shines as a symbol of Christ. On the semicircle of the Apse a Latin inscript reads, according to Martin Luther's translation: &quot;Lord, I have love for the site of your house and the place where your glory resides&quot;.

The altar canopy, which rests on four dark green columns, was created from Siberian jasper (semi-precious stones) and was a gift from Tsar Nicholas I of Russia, the king's brother in law. It was installed in the Church of Peace in 1842.

In the right-hand aisle lies the former baptistery. The six-sided baptismal stone was relocated in 1965.

The counterpart to the baptistery is the sacristy in the left-hand aisle. After the death of Frederick William IV it was used temporarily as a mausoleum for him and for other deceased members of the House of Hohenzollern. The son of Emperor Friedrich III and his wife Empress Victoria, as well as the Princes Sigismund and Waldemar, were entombed here until 1892. In 1920 the youngest son of Wilhelm II, the last Emperor of Germany, was laid to rest in the sacristy. After 1931 he was moved to the Ancient Temple.

Under two marble tablets, embedded in the ground in front of the steps of the altar room, the royal crypt can be found. Frederick William IV died following several strokes on 2 January 1861, and following the dedication of the crypt in October 1864 his coffin was placed there. The heart of the king, however, rests in the mausoleum of the Charlottenhof in Berlin. He was laid in the ground at the feet of his parents, King Frederick William III and Queen Louise.

In 1873 his wife Elisabeth Ludovika followed him to the grave. Both coffins, made out of English tin, carry the same inscript as the marble plates in the church floor: &quot;Here he rests in God, his Redeemer, in the hope of resurrection in the soul and a merciful judgement,...","false","false","false","true","false",26-JUN-07,06-MAR-11,26-JUN-07,,27,26,"63d3601015","http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1197/633285397_634c92767c_o.jpg","634c92767c",4

The car has a hand-finished fibreglass body shell atop its bonded extruded aluminium chassis that provides a rigid platform for the suspension, while keeping weight and production costs to a minimum. The roadster is capable of speeds up to 240 km/h (150 mph).[2] The Elise was named after Elisa, the granddaughter of Romano Artioli who was chairman of Lotus at the time of the car's launch.

The roadster is capable of speeds up to 240 km/h (150 mph).[2] The Elise was named after Elisa, the granddaughter of Romano Artioli who was chairman of Lotus at the time of the car's launch.

<b>Architecture


Architecture (Latin architectura, from the Greek ἀρχιτέκτων – arkhitekton, from ἀρχι- &quot;chief&quot; and τέκτων &quot;builder, carpenter&quot;) can mean:

    * The art and science of designing and erecting buildings and other physical structures.
    * The practice of an architect, where architecture means to offer or render professional services in connection with the design and construction of a building, or group of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings, that have as their principal purpose human occupancy or use.
    * A general term to describe buildings and other structures.
    * A style and method of design and construction of buildings and other physical structures.

A wider definition may comprise all design activity, from the macro-level (urban design, landscape architecture) to the micro-level (construction details and furniture). Architecture is both the process and product of planning, designing and constructing form, space and ambience that reflect functional, technical, social, and aesthetic considerations. It requires the creative manipulation and coordination of material, technology, light and shadow. Architecture also encompasses the pragmatic aspects of realising buildings and structures, including scheduling, cost estimating and construction administration. As documentation produced by architects, typically drawings, plans and technical specifications, architecture defines the structure and/or behavior of a building or any other kind of system that is to be or has been constructed.

Architectural works are often perceived as cultural and political symbols and as works of art. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements.

Architecture sometimes refers to the activity of designing any kind of system and the term is common in the information technology world.

<b>Architecture


Architecture (Latin architectura, from the Greek ἀρχιτέκτων – arkhitekton, from ἀρχι- &quot;chief&quot; and τέκτων &quot;builder, carpenter&quot;) can mean:

    * The art and science of designing and erecting buildings and other physical structures.
    * The practice of an architect, where architecture means to offer or render professional services in connection with the design and construction of a building, or group of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings, that have as their principal purpose human occupancy or use.
    * A general term to describe buildings and other structures.
    * A style and method of design and construction of buildings and other physical structures.

A wider definition may comprise all design activity, from the macro-level (urban design, landscape architecture) to the micro-level (construction details and furniture). Architecture is both the process and product of planning, designing and constructing form, space and ambience that reflect functional, technical, social, and aesthetic considerations. It requires the creative manipulation and coordination of material, technology, light and shadow. Architecture also encompasses the pragmatic aspects of realising buildings and structures, including scheduling, cost estimating and construction administration. As documentation produced by architects, typically drawings, plans and technical specifications, architecture defines the structure and/or behavior of a building or any other kind of system that is to be or has been constructed.

Architectural works are often perceived as cultural and political symbols and as works of art. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements.

Architecture sometimes refers to the activity of designing any kind of system and the term is common in the information technology world.

Charles Rennie Mackintosh (1868-1928) est un architecte, peintre et designer, né à Glasgow, qui est considéré comme un des principaux précurseurs du mouvement moderne.

Avec Margaret Macdonald, qui est devenue son épouse en 1900, son ami Herbert McNair et son épouse Frances Macdonald, la soeur de Margaret, tous issus de la &quot;Glasgow School of Art&quot;, il a constitué un groupe d'artistes très novateurs pour l'époque appelé &quot;The Four&quot;, influencé par l'Art Nouveau, le Symbolisme et par le mouvement anglais &quot;Arts and Crafts&quot;.

noci jsou bez vína dlouhé ...  (a dobré víno je jako žena)

ANDRÉ BRETON (1896-1966)
Volná láska

Má žena s kšticí hořícího lesa
S myšlenkami žárných blesků
S pasem přesýpacích hodin
Má žena s pasem vydry mezi tygřími zuby
Má žena s ústy jako kokarda a kytice hvězd největší velikosti
Se zuby otisků bílé myšky na bílé zemi
S jazykem hlazené ambry a broušeného skla
Má žena s jazykem probodené hostie
S jazykem panenky která otvírá a zavírá oči
S jazykem neobyčejného démantu
Má žena s řasami dětského hůlkového písma 
S obočím okraje vlaštovčího hnízda 
Má žena se spánky z břidlicové střechy skleníku 
A páry na oknech 
Má žena s rameny ze šampaňského vína 
A z pramene z delfíních hlav pod ledem 
Má žena se zápěstím zápalek 
Má žena s prsty náhody a srdcového esa 
S prsty koseného sena 
(…) 
Má žena se stehny jako labutí šíje 
Má žena se stehny jara 
S pohlavím mečíků 
Má žena s pohlavím zlatého ložiska a ptakopyska 
Má žena s pohlavím vodní řasy a bonbónů ze starých časů 
Má žena s pohlavím zrcadla 
Má žena s očima plnýma slzí 
S očima fialového brnění a magnetické střelky 
Má žena s očima savany 
Má žena s očima vody k pití ve vězení 
Má žena s očima stromů stále pod sekyrou 
S očima hladiny vody hladiny vzduchu země a ohně

Freedom of love by Andre Breton
(Translated from the French by Edouard Rodti)

My wife with the hair of a wood fire
With the thoughts of heat lightning
With the waist of an hourglass
With the waist of an otter in the teeth of a tiger
My wife with the lips of a cockade and of a bunch of stars of the last magnitude
With the teeth of tracks of white mice on the white earth
With the tongue of rubbed amber and glass
My wife with the tongue of a stabbed host
With the tongue of a doll that opens and closes its eyes
With the tongue of an unbelievable stone
My wife with the eyelashes of strokes of a child's writing
With brows of the edge of a swallow's nest
My wife with the brow of slates of a hothouse roof
And of steam on the panes
My wife with shoulders of champagne
And of a fountain with dolphin-heads beneath the ice
My wife with wrists of matches
My wife with fingers of luck and ace of hearts
With fingers of mown hay
My wife with armpits of marten and of beechnut
And of Midsummer Night
Of privet and of an angelfish nest
With arms of seafoam and of riverlocks
And of a mingling of the wheat and the mill
My wife with legs of flares
With the movements of clockwork and despair
My wife with calves of eldertree pith
My wife with feet of initials
With feet of rings of keys and Java sparrows drinking
My wife with a neck of unpearled barley
My wife with a throat of the valley of gold
Of a tryst in the very bed of the torrent
With breasts of night
My wife with breasts of a marine molehill
My wife with breasts of the ruby's crucible
With breasts of the rose's spectre beneath the dew
My wife with the belly of an unfolding of the fan of days
With the belly of a gigantic claw
My wife with the back of a bird fleeing vertically
With a back of quicksilver
With a back of light
With a nape of rolled stone and wet chalk
And of the drop of a glass where one has just been drinking
My wife with hips of a skiff
With hips of a chandelier and of arrow-feathers
And of shafts of white peacock plumes
Of an insensible pendulum
My wife with buttocks of sandstone and asbestos
My wife with buttocks of swans' backs
My wife with buttocks of spring
With the sex of an iris
My wife with the sex of a mining-placer and of a platypus
My wife with a sex of seaweed and ancient sweetmeat
My wife with a sex of mirror
My wife with eyes full of tears
With eyes of purple panoply and of a magnetic needle
My wife with savanna eyes
My wife with eyes of water to he drunk in prison
My wife with eyes of wood always under the axe
My wife with eyes of water-level of level of air earth and fire ","false","false","false","true","false",01-SEP-09,15-NOV-09,14-NOV-09,,4,1,"8b0c648136","http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2584/4102377981_302b13effd_o.jpg","302b13effd",4

"3344235113","Curtiss R3C-2 Racer","http://www.flickr.com/photos/nostri-imago/3344235113/","28567825@N03","The R3C-1 was a single-seat, single-bay, wire-braced biplane. The wings were covered with twoply spruce planking. 3/32-inch thick, forming a box structure that required no internal bracing. Among the interesting features were the low-drag wing radiators made of corrugated brass sheeting, .004-inch thick, covering much of the surface of both upper and lower wings with the corrugations running chordwise. The upper wing was flush with the top of the fuselage, permitting the pilot to see over the wing. All ribs were of spruce conforming to the Curtiss C-80 airfoil section, and the ailerons, made of metal, were fabric-covered. The cantilever vertical fin and horizontal stabilizer were of wood.

An ingeniously fabricated streamlined monocoque structure, the fuselage consisted of a shell of two layers of spruce over which fabric was doped for added strength and protection. This shell was formed over seven birch plywood bulkheads that were connected by four ash longerons, making a rigid structure.

The unbalanced movable controls were metal. Only necessary navigation and engine instruments were installed. They consisted of gauges for water temperature, oil temperature, oil pressure, and fuel quantity, as well as a tachometer and an airspeed indicator.

The fixed landing gear in the R3C-1 was a tripod configuration. A laminated hickory tail skid was added to protect the rudder.

As a landplane, the R3C-1 carried only 27 gallons of fuel, which gave 48 minutes flying time at full throttle. In the R3C-2, the fuel capacity was increased to 60 gallons, enough for 1.3 hours at full throttle, by installing fuel tanks in the floats.

The wings and elevators were painted gold; the fuselage, stabilizer, fin, struts, fairings, cowling, pontoons and/or wheels were all black.

Contemporary star cockades were painted on the right and left sides of the upper surface of the top wing and the lower surface of the bottom wing, outboard of the wing radiators. The rudder was painted with red, white, and blue vertical stripes, the blue stripe being next to the rudderpost. Both sides of the vertical fin were lettered ‘U.S. Army,&quot; in white. On both sides of the fuselage aft of the cockpit a large numeral 43 was painted in white. This was the number used in the Pulitzer Race. When flown in the 1925 Schneider Race, the aircraft carried the number 3, and in the 1926 Schneider Trophy Race it was numbered 6.

It was on loan for several years to the Air Force Museum, where it was restored by Air Force personnel. It now hangs in the Pioneers of Flight gallery at the National Air and Space Museum.

<b>Yarn:</b> Samos Novita, colorway 300, 50% cotton and 50% acryl, kindly donated by my Secret Pal. I like it a lot -- it is very soft, slightly flexible, not splitty at all. I wish we had it in our Dutch yarn stores, but apparently it's a typically Finnish yarn brand...
<b>Hook:</b> 5mm, aluminium.
<b>Modification:</b> I added a row of slip stitches to the upper border of the hat, to make the top concave rather than convex (looks more cowboy-ish).
<b>Still want to add:</b> an applique felt star for my little sheriff; a decorative but simple ribbon and another ribbon to tie the hat to my playful boy's head :-)

It looks great on the recipient -- who is, at this moment, taking his afternoon nap. Thank you, Secret Pal, and I hope you like the way I used the yarn you sent me :-)

A winter sailor outfit with long sleeves on a mannequin.Japan introduced school uniforms in the late 19th century. Today, school uniforms are common in many of the Japanese public and private school systems. The Japanese word for this type of uniform is seifuku (制服?).

[edit] UsageThe Japanese junior- and senior-high-school uniform traditionally consists of a military style uniform for boys and a sailor outfit for girls. These uniforms are based on Meiji era formal military dress, themselves modeled on European-style naval uniforms. The sailor outfit replace the undivided hakama (andon bakama 行灯袴) designed by Utako Shimoda between 1920–30.[1] While this style of uniform is still in use, many schools have moved to more Western-pattern parochial school uniform styles. These uniforms consist of a white shirt, tie, blazer with school crest, and tailored trousers (often not of the same color as the blazer) for boys and a white blouse, tie, blazer with school crest, and tartan culottes or skirt for girls.

 
In the classroom, as in their home, Japanese students are required to take off the shoes they wear outdoors and put on their uwabaki, a kind of soft slipper meant to be used only indoors.Regardless of what type of uniform any particular school assigns its students, all schools have a summer version of the uniform (usually consisting of just a white dress shirt and the uniform slacks for boys and a reduced-weight traditional uniform or blouse and tartan skirt with tie for girls) and a sports-activity uniform (a polyester track suit for year-round use and a t-shirt and short pants for summer activities). Depending on the discipline level of any particular school, students may often wear different seasonal and activity uniforms within the same classroom during the day. Individual students may attempt to subvert the system of uniforms by wearing their uniforms incorrectly or by adding prohibited elements such as large loose socks or badges. Girls may shorten their skirts, permanently or by wrapping up the top to decrease length; boys may wear trousers about the hips, omit ties, or keep their shirts unbuttoned.

Since some schools do not have sex-segregated changing- or locker-rooms, students may change for sporting activities in their classrooms. As a result, such students may wear their sports uniforms under their classroom uniforms. Certain schools also regulate student hairstyles, footwear, and book bags; but these particular rules are usually adhered to only on special occasions, such as trimester opening and closing ceremonies and school photo days.

It is normal for uniforms to be worn outside of school areas, however this is going out of fashion and many students wear a casual dress.[2] While not many public elementary schools in Japan require uniforms, many private schools and public schools run by the central government still do so.

[edit] Gakuran 
Museum exhibit of the uniforms of the Ichikawa Gakuen school. The middle mannequin is displaying a gakuran.The gakuran (学ラン?) or the tsume-eri (詰襟?) are the uniforms for many middle school and high school boys in Japan. The color is normally black, but some schools use navy and dark blue as well.

The top has a standing collar buttoning down from top-to-bottom. Buttons are usually decorated with the school emblem to show respect to the school. Pants are straight leg and a black or dark-colored belt is worn with them. Boys usually wear penny loafers or sneakers with this uniform. Some schools may require the students to wear collar-pins representing the school and/or class rank.

At the end of a long trail ride, four cowboys got a buzz at the local saloon and decided to commemorate the event by having their picture taken at the photographer’s studio just down the street. 

Well, probably not. It seems to be a fake.  But, how fake is it?

First of all, all four are wearing dress ties under their bandannas.  Three of them are wearing suit coats all tucked in under their gun belts and chaps.  The one on the left even has a kerchief peeking out of his breast pocket.  

The one on the far right seems to be wearing a horizontal stripe pattern narrow tie or maybe that’s just the narrow end of the tie showing, the wide half being tucked up under that big bandanna.  Second-from-right has his collar unbuttoned and his diagonal stripe tie loosened at the neck. Second-from-left has his collar buttoned and his tie up tight.  Left-end wears a solid color wide tie.

Their hats are all too big.  They rest on their ears.  Second-from-right has his pushed well back on his head.  The other three have the front brim turned up to put light on their faces for the camera.  These hats are probably photographer’s props.  

Dusty cattle trail riders?  No, probably not. Here are four young men at a county or state fair getting their picture taken at the photo booth with fake cowboy costumes.  That’s a more likely scenario.  Their girlfriends stood off camera and teased them.  Note the one on the left end is looking in a different direction than the rest. He also appears to be speaking.

When?  

According to the postcard backing, the AZO design in the upper right hand corner indicates it was printed between 1904 and 1918.  For the moment, let’s say it is not a counterfeit backing to give an “authentic” edge to the fake novelty photograph on the front.

The photo qualities seem true for the time period just before 1918.  The face of our cowboy on the left is slightly blurred.  He moved.  The slow shutters of the time would have captured that movement as a slight blur.  Faster film media and lenses and consequently shutters didn’t appear until a little later.

The eyes of second-from-left seem very light.  As we have learned, blues tended to photograph as white in early photo media, just as reds tend to appear black.  Second-from-right has what appears to be leather chaps, probably brown, making his suit probably brown also since they appear to be similar gray in the photo.  First on left is probably dressed in blue.  Since it seems to be a joke type photo, the chaps on second from right might very well be bright red.  Well, maybe not.

The black wedge in the lower right corner might indicate that the light sensitive media was not quite straight in the carrier when it was exposed.  That is something that a good expensive studio photographer would not allow, nor would their customer accept.  This was probably a carnival or fair or other novelty operation.

The paper stock is the right weight for the time.  The yellowing, fading and wrinkles seem appropriate for the age.

With today’s technology, we know it could ALL be faked on a home desktop computer and printer.  For paper you could use the blank flyleaf pages of old law books or catalogs.  Without the use of a very technical lab to test the chemical composition of the emulsion on the front or the ink on the reverse, it would be hard to tell if it was printed yesterday or really nearly a hundred years ago.  And what junk store shopper is going to go to all that trouble?  An enterprising junk dealer could whip up a few of these to shuffle among a few real ones and maybe peddle them for four or six dollars each.  The good sellers could be printed over and over.

What do you think?

At the end of a long trail ride, four cowboys got a buzz at the local saloon and decided to commemorate the event by having their picture taken at the photographer’s studio just down the street. 

Well, probably not. It seems to be a fake.  But, how fake is it?

First of all, all four are wearing dress ties under their bandannas.  Three of them are wearing suit coats all tucked in under their gun belts and chaps.  The one on the left even has a kerchief peeking out of his breast pocket.  

The one on the far right seems to be wearing a horizontal stripe pattern narrow tie or maybe that’s just the narrow end of the tie showing, the wide half being tucked up under that big bandanna.  Second-from-right has his collar unbuttoned and his diagonal stripe tie loosened at the neck. Second-from-left has his collar buttoned and his tie up tight.  Left-end wears a solid color wide tie.

- added a band that went around the back to connect the front panels
- cut through that band to add a button enclosure once I realized the final product would be too tight to wiggle into
- added darts on either side of the back to close the gapping resulting from my inaccurate measurements

The halter neck part still doesn't have a proper closure other than tying the raw edges off, but I will get to that today, I think. 

Problems with the construction: not having proper gathers at the bust, nor any darting, results in some space issues, because I have too much bust for the room allowed. So, when I try to wear this on its own there is some odd mashing going on.

Hawa Mahal (Hindi: हवा महल, translation: &quot;Palace of Winds&quot; or “Palace of the Breeze”), is a palace in Jaipur, India. It was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, and designed by Lal Chand Usta in the form of the crown of Krishna, the Hindu god. Its unique five-storey exterior is also akin to the honeycomb of the beehive with its 953 small windows called jharokhas that are decorated with intricate lattice work. The original intention of the lattice was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life in the street below without being seen, since they had to observe strict &quot;purdah&quot; (face cover).
Built of red and pink sandstone, the palace is situated on the main thoroughfare in the heart of Jaipur’s business centre. It forms part of the City Palace, and extends to the Zenana or women's chambers, the chambers of the harem. It is particularly striking when viewed early in the morning, lit with the golden light of sunrise.","false","false","false","true","false",08-MAY-09,10-SEP-10,29-JUL-10,,15,0,"77ef4dc263","http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4089/4840230703_e1de1bb968_o.jpg","e1de1bb968",4

design / photography / edit by HuangFeiLung 

VillAge is an experimental fashion research and design project based on the studies of Taiwanese village wears and documentaries that HuangFeiLung has been collecting over the years. In Taiwan like most modern countries, city people look down on the ones who dress or act like coming from countryside. It’s just about hatred in the bias of fashion world. The “images” they are wearing represent their background and personality which contain so many unique trends and forms that we should not feel shame about. I, living in Taiwan feel obligated to restore and reform my image of village wears that belong here. Furthermore, VillAge project is actually trying reinterpret these forgotten Taiwanese styles and cultural wears using modern fusion and imagination to create a new statement of Taiwanese old time fashion.

Country and Trucker is the first issue of VillAge concept. FeiLung Huang, uses pop fashion accessory such as “trucker caps” to wrapped with many different symbolic  colors, patterns, and textures of cloth. This way of cloth design and wrapping used to be applied on the farmer's bamboo hat (easily seen in Asian tea farms) in order to keep the wind from blown away. Mixing these two accessories to creat a series of bazaar looking Country and Trucker girls.

I may just have to put this picture in context by putting up another picture of this exotic young woman.

Calf Robe was deserted by his fellow warriors in enemy country and left to die; but he was soon rescued by a large grizzly bear, who brought him food and carried him to help near Fort Benton.

Might the 'twin moon∩gates' represent the <b>'twin towers'</b>? Are the eleven tar-filled circles esoteric mourning memorials for 9/11? 
─► Another question: How did the puzzling sedimentation-like black halo come about? - Most likely: The thin film of water on the hygrophilous tar evaporated quickly and left the fringe pattern. Less likely: Melted, gravel-free tar as a kind of sealing wax. Chromatographicly. Osmoticly. Silver Thaw.

Auguste Rodin (1840-1917)
Oeuvre exposée au Centre Pompidou Metz dans l'exposition &quot;Chefs d'oeuvre&quot;

&quot;Près de 50 ans après la mort de Balzac, la Société des Gens de Lettres décide d'élever un monument à sa mémoire. Sur les conseils de Zola, la commande est passée à Rodin. Rodin y travaille plus de 6 ans...Exposée en 1898 au Salon de la Nationale, cette oeuvre a provoqué l'un des scandales les plus retentissants du 19ème siècle. &quot; extrait de la présentation de l'oeuvre au Centre Pompidou Metz.

This incident is supposed to have happened about 1870.

"282246695","fit for a Princess","http://www.flickr.com/photos/calliope/282246695/","53133240@N00","Last night I slept in my own bed for the first time in almost two months. First, I was in the hospital for several weeks. Then, when I came home, I had one long incision that ran down my back and around my side, as well as numerous small incisions. These made sleeping difficult. So I wound up making various sleeping nests all over the house, the way an old dog does. 
The first few nights, I slept in my living room recliner. That felt just silly. Then I moved to the downstairs sofa bed, which has a relatively soft mattress. I raised the head by putting pillows beneath the mattress, which mimicked the hospital bed. Over time, I replaced the pillows with smaller ones. 
After a week or so, I wanted to be back upstairs, since I have an irrational belief that sleeping should take place on the second floor of a two-story house. But my own bed was very firm--how come I never noticed how firm it was before?--so I moved into the guest room. Once again, I arranged pillows and wedges for comfort, but I wanted to be where my clothes were. 
Finally, I was less sore, I could actually roll over, and I was ready for my own bed. I stuck pillows under the mattress to raise the head a bit; I placed a feather bed on top of the mattress to soften it a bit; I arranged lots of down pillows so I could grab them and prop arms or legs; and I got out the flannel (flannel sheets and flannel comforter cover) and the extra down throw, just in case my feet got cold. I slept like a baby, and when I awoke, I looked at my bed and realized that it would have been a fit resting place for the Princess in the Princess and the Pea story.

1899, by William Henman and Thomas Cooper for Dr J E Parrott. In an Arts and
Crafts style and as subtly asymmetrical as it is interesting. Brick and stone.
Three storeys plus attic; 3 bays beneath a big gable plus a fourth narrow bay
representing the plane of the street and with a narrow sash window in moulded
surround on each floor. Ground floor rectangular in plan with 2 arched windows
on the left, the entrance up steps within an arched porch and 3 narrow flat-headed
sash windows on the right. Above the rectangular ground floor 2 canted bay windows
rise through first and second floors divided by french windows above the entrance
that give on to the balconies formed by a balustraded arcade at first floor level
and by a range of Tuscan columns at second floor level. The fenestration of the 2
bay windows completely different and the left-hand one at first floor level even
seems to indicate 2 floors. In the gable a tripartite window beneath a semi-circular
pediment; either side of the gable a pedimented dormer window. Nothing inside. One
of an important group of houses.

Although some scholars have argued that is cannot be Anne, a careful review of their reasoning reveals that they simply don't want this to be what she looked like--a very common problem that clouds the judgement of even the most serious historians. The fact remains that this image was identified by Edward VI's tutor John Cheke, who knew her and was right more than wrong on all of his identifications of Holbein's sitters; that it accords amazingly well with the facial type of earliest French Hood portraits and the &quot;Moost Happi&quot; medal; and that the sitter clearly possesses the dramatic dark eyes that Anne was noted as having.

Super comfortable, light weight hoodie we did not want to take off! Love the details on the sleeves! Fits true to size, and we are obsessed with this style of thumbholes! It's the little things right?

Fit Guru Elim is wearing a size 4 and Fit Guru Whitney is wearing a size 8

Why We Made This:

* This is the hoodie you want to wear every day - for yoga, tea, biking, dating…not in this order specifically
* Our own blend of cotton french terry has stretch so it won't bag out!
* Inner mesh pocket to keep your card, key or cash in a safe place
* Added thumbholes for keeping sleeves in place
* Chafe resistant flat seams for comfort
* Preshrunk so there are no surprises when you wash me and zipper won't buckle!

Hotel. Begun 1897, completed 1899, by C Orlando Law. Red
brick, Portland stone dressings, slate and lead roofs.
STYLE: in a vigorous Northern Renaissance style with Flemish
details.
PLAN: the large symmetrical main building has a short return
wing of full height to the right, and is connected by a long,
wide central one-storey lobby, and a former carriage house, to
the ballroom across the back (in Gloucester Mews). The main
staircase, with later inserted lift, lies to the left of the
lobby. The bedrooms are paired to full-width central
corridors.
EXTERIOR: main front is 4 storeys, attics and basement, in
3:4:1:4:3 pattern of fenestration, mainly casements. There are
octagonal end pavilions and a central gabled bay slightly
brought forward; a 'triumphal arch' portico is flanked by
large glazed verandah bays. Four 2-light casement dormers each
side have low pedimented fronts, with returned cornice mould;
at this level the octagons have small-paned lights in arched
heads and decorative tympana, with small paired columns to the
corners, blind balustrade, and deep coved cornice with
brackets to ogee-curve decorative lead cupolas carrying small
turrets with pyramidal capping and flagstaff. The central
gable, with banded brick and stonework and terminal panel, has
small paired deep-set lights with pediment.
The fourth floor lights form a continuous frieze band, with
2-light windows under flat elliptical arches carried on
columns to lion-head corbels below the sill band. At the
corner turrets the treatment is simplified, but with a bold
cornice, and the central unit has 2 deep lights with transom,
under a decorative frieze, and on a railed balcony above a
2-storey curved bow.
Second-floor windows are 2-light, full-depth, with transom,
and under a transom light, with crown-like lintels; these 4
openings each side give to a continuous balcony with flat
elliptical plan, and iron balustrade, above 2 bows at first floor.
The turrets have plain sashes, and the central bay a stone
flat bow window with curved end lights, and segmental heads,
under a moulded cornice. At first floor are paired bows, each
with 3 pairs of French windows to a continuous balcony with
iron balustrade. At this level the brickwork is banded with
stone, and the windows each have 3 stone voussoirs. The
turrets are similarly treated, but with 2-light windows to
arched heads.
The central bay has a stone bow similar to that at second
floor. The central portico on 6 steps with nosings has paired
Ionic columns to a central elliptical arch with keystone,
flanked by vertical oval oculi, and to a moulded cornice, with
balcony rail and stone balustrade above. This covers C20
glazed doors with original paned side-lights, and column
responds, echoing the outer detail. To each side are 2 wide
bays, divided by paired pilasters, with 3 small-pane transom
lights forming a frieze above 4 vertical panes; the end lights
are bowed, with curved glass.
Below the main glazing are panels of rich cast-iron work, with
sunburst and ship motifs, below which are open balustrades
giving some light to the basement windows set back below. The
turrets at ground floor have plain sashes with pediments, and
a canted light connects with the main glazing.
The return wing has a series of 2-light dormers above a stone
eaves course and a deep plain frieze, and several deep stacks
in brick with some stone banding. Set back to left of street
front is a single bay with wide ...","false","false","false","true","false",01-MAY-12,06-JUN-12,15-MAY-12,,24,0,"9e3bfcb076","http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5079/7202635954_fae50e7182_o.jpg","fae50e7182",4

Hotel. Begun 1897, completed 1899, by C Orlando Law. Red
brick, Portland stone dressings, slate and lead roofs.
STYLE: in a vigorous Northern Renaissance style with Flemish
details.
PLAN: the large symmetrical main building has a short return
wing of full height to the right, and is connected by a long,
wide central one-storey lobby, and a former carriage house, to
the ballroom across the back (in Gloucester Mews). The main
staircase, with later inserted lift, lies to the left of the
lobby. The bedrooms are paired to full-width central
corridors.
EXTERIOR: main front is 4 storeys, attics and basement, in
3:4:1:4:3 pattern of fenestration, mainly casements. There are
octagonal end pavilions and a central gabled bay slightly
brought forward; a 'triumphal arch' portico is flanked by
large glazed verandah bays. Four 2-light casement dormers each
side have low pedimented fronts, with returned cornice mould;
at this level the octagons have small-paned lights in arched
heads and decorative tympana, with small paired columns to the
corners, blind balustrade, and deep coved cornice with
brackets to ogee-curve decorative lead cupolas carrying small
turrets with pyramidal capping and flagstaff. The central
gable, with banded brick and stonework and terminal panel, has
small paired deep-set lights with pediment.
The fourth floor lights form a continuous frieze band, with
2-light windows under flat elliptical arches carried on
columns to lion-head corbels below the sill band. At the
corner turrets the treatment is simplified, but with a bold
cornice, and the central unit has 2 deep lights with transom,
under a decorative frieze, and on a railed balcony above a
2-storey curved bow.
Second-floor windows are 2-light, full-depth, with transom,
and under a transom light, with crown-like lintels; these 4
openings each side give to a continuous balcony with flat
elliptical plan, and iron balustrade, above 2 bows at first floor.
The turrets have plain sashes, and the central bay a stone
flat bow window with curved end lights, and segmental heads,
under a moulded cornice. At first floor are paired bows, each
with 3 pairs of French windows to a continuous balcony with
iron balustrade. At this level the brickwork is banded with
stone, and the windows each have 3 stone voussoirs. The
turrets are similarly treated, but with 2-light windows to
arched heads.
The central bay has a stone bow similar to that at second
floor. The central portico on 6 steps with nosings has paired
Ionic columns to a central elliptical arch with keystone,
flanked by vertical oval oculi, and to a moulded cornice, with
balcony rail and stone balustrade above. This covers C20
glazed doors with original paned side-lights, and column
responds, echoing the outer detail. To each side are 2 wide
bays, divided by paired pilasters, with 3 small-pane transom
lights forming a frieze above 4 vertical panes; the end lights
are bowed, with curved glass.
Below the main glazing are panels of rich cast-iron work, with
sunburst and ship motifs, below which are open balustrades
giving some light to the basement windows set back below. The
turrets at ground floor have plain sashes with pediments, and
a canted light connects with the main glazing.

eaves course and a deep plain frieze, and several deep stacks

Hotel. Begun 1897, completed 1899, by C Orlando Law. Red
brick, Portland stone dressings, slate and lead roofs.
STYLE: in a vigorous Northern Renaissance style with Flemish
details.
PLAN: the large symmetrical main building has a short return
wing of full height to the right, and is connected by a long,
wide central one-storey lobby, and a former carriage house, to
the ballroom across the back (in Gloucester Mews). The main
staircase, with later inserted lift, lies to the left of the
lobby. The bedrooms are paired to full-width central
corridors.
EXTERIOR: main front is 4 storeys, attics and basement, in
3:4:1:4:3 pattern of fenestration, mainly casements. There are
octagonal end pavilions and a central gabled bay slightly
brought forward; a 'triumphal arch' portico is flanked by
large glazed verandah bays. Four 2-light casement dormers each
side have low pedimented fronts, with returned cornice mould;
at this level the octagons have small-paned lights in arched
heads and decorative tympana, with small paired columns to the
corners, blind balustrade, and deep coved cornice with
brackets to ogee-curve decorative lead cupolas carrying small
turrets with pyramidal capping and flagstaff. The central
gable, with banded brick and stonework and terminal panel, has
small paired deep-set lights with pediment.
The fourth floor lights form a continuous frieze band, with
2-light windows under flat elliptical arches carried on
columns to lion-head corbels below the sill band. At the
corner turrets the treatment is simplified, but with a bold
cornice, and the central unit has 2 deep lights with transom,
under a decorative frieze, and on a railed balcony above a
2-storey curved bow.
Second-floor windows are 2-light, full-depth, with transom,
and under a transom light, with crown-like lintels; these 4
openings each side give to a continuous balcony with flat
elliptical plan, and iron balustrade, above 2 bows at first floor.
The turrets have plain sashes, and the central bay a stone
flat bow window with curved end lights, and segmental heads,
under a moulded cornice. At first floor are paired bows, each
with 3 pairs of French windows to a continuous balcony with
iron balustrade. At this level the brickwork is banded with
stone, and the windows each have 3 stone voussoirs. The
turrets are similarly treated, but with 2-light windows to
arched heads.
The central bay has a stone bow similar to that at second
floor. The central portico on 6 steps with nosings has paired
Ionic columns to a central elliptical arch with keystone,
flanked by vertical oval oculi, and to a moulded cornice, with
balcony rail and stone balustrade above. This covers C20
glazed doors with original paned side-lights, and column
responds, echoing the outer detail. To each side are 2 wide
bays, divided by paired pilasters, with 3 small-pane transom
lights forming a frieze above 4 vertical panes; the end lights
are bowed, with curved glass.
Below the main glazing are panels of rich cast-iron work, with
sunburst and ship motifs, below which are open balustrades
giving some light to the basement windows set back below. The
turrets at ground floor have plain sashes with pediments, and
a canted light connects with the main glazing.
The return wing has a series of 2-light dormers above a stone
eaves course and a deep plain frieze, and several deep stacks
in brick with some stone banding. Set back to left of street
front is a single bay with wide ...","false","false","false","true","false",01-MAY-12,15-MAY-12,15-MAY-12,,20,0,"512f479ae6","http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5446/7202630610_ef29239d6c_o.jpg","ef29239d6c",4

It is only Grade II listed, I thought it might be higher, but maybe thats due to the restoration and changes in the 20th century. It also dates back to the 15th century.

The various shields / coat of arms on the Guildhall.

I was walking on the same side as it and was too close (later got it from the other side of the road).

Based on the one on the Old Royal, I think that this enscription is in French. Looks like the arms of a Knight.

Guildhall for Guild of Holy Trinity and St John; part now
library. C15, extensively restored 1915 by WJ Fieldhouse.
Timber-frame with brick infill on stone plinth, with stone
ground floor until 1915; gabled roof with renewed tiles and
C20 brick cross-axial stack with 2 diagonal shafts and rear
lateral stack. 3-unit and cross-passage.

Entrance to left of centre and one to right end with 4-centred
heads and moulded Tudor-headed arches to plank doors, one to
right end with overlight and small-paned glazed panel;
bracketed hoods.
Windows have leaded glazing. Ground floor has 3 large windows
with bowed small-paned glazing; first floor has 4-light
wood-mullioned windows. Gutter on curved iron brackets and
lead downspouts with enriched rainwater head. Late C20 painted
shields below first-floor windows.
Left return has close studding to both floors and small lights
to ground floor; right return has entrance as above and small
first-floor light with stained glass.
Rear has 2 external lateral stacks, one with 2 enriched
octagonal shafts; entrance up stone steps to left end has
battened door, steps with wooden balustrade; ground floor has
2 5-light transomed windows and 3 with single lights;
first-floor windows as to front.
INTERIOR: altered ground floor with staircase to first floor,
which has 3 roof trusses with arch-braced cambered tie beams,
5 struts and collars, 2 with double-chamfered ties and braces;
mortices to former partitions; wind braces. South window has
reset C15 stained glass with figure of St Anthony and Arms of
Lord Dudley, 1440-87.
Important position next to the church.

It is only Grade II listed, I thought it might be higher, but maybe thats due to the restoration and changes in the 20th century. It also dates back to the 15th century.

The various shields / coat of arms on the Guildhall.

Based on the one on the Old Royal, I think that this enscription is in French. Looks like the arms of a Knight.

I looked hours on end for these stamps, and it was if they were the gateway to another realm, a portal - my only way. Hell, there was no way I was going to spend another 10 bucks on 6 stamps without a fight. So, I continued to pace around my room for another two week, in my red slippers, looking for home. Oh France stamps, almost were frowned upon like France tramps at the end of this adventure.

Obviously, it was my foot's fault, so I looked in my life for other opportunities, other search methods. And where better than a DICTIONARY? And guess what, when I looked in my dictionary; out popped FRANCE STAMPS! From the god book; of words; of diction; of life; of stamps?

Inverness has been the penal centre of the Highlands for quite some time, albeit local jails were also maintained in many Highland towns.

Originally the old main bridge over the River Ness housed prisoners in cells built into the bridge piers, until Mother Nature removed the bridge in a flood. Thereafter the gaol moved to the new Tollbooth in the Town Centre, only the Town Steeple of which remains. It also conveniently housed the Headquarters of the Police of the Burgh. 

In the 1840s an extension (The North Tower) to Inverness Castle was constructed, part of which became the prison, and the County Police also shared the building. Finally in 1902 a new prison for the Highlands was opened at Porterfield, a short distance from the Castle, and HM Prison Inverness has been there ever since. As a result of the move, the Inverness-shire Constabulary were able to expand their HQ by taking over  the former prison area of the Castle.

In 2002, to commemorate the Centenary of the &quot;new&quot; HMP, the SPS (Scottish Prison Service) marked the anniversary by staging a re-construction of the move, in which the Northern Constabulary was also invited to participate.

Yours truly (as Force Historian) was approached by Supt Bruce Duncan (Area Commander) as to what involvement the force could provide, and I  suggested the presence of officers dressed in both County and Burgh Police uniforms, in view of the close relationship both forces have had with the prisons over the years.

Thankfully, the antique uniforms in my possession had all shrunk (!!) so that they no longer fitted me, so the two Community Safety Officers at Inverness volunteered (?) their services.

Constables Duncan Carmichael and Mel Fowler, garbed in authentic turn-of-the century Inverness-shire and Inverness Burgh uniforms respectively, attended at Inverness Castle on 17th October 2002 and met with two Prison Officers, also clad in period uniform, and proceeded to march a &quot;prisoner&quot; from The Castle to the &quot;new&quot; prison. 

Once up the brae into the Crown area the &quot;prisoner&quot; was transferred to a period Prison Cart, which took him the rest of the way to the &quot;new&quot; prison, still escorted by the two officers.

Duncan is wearing a shako cap (which had been in use for some years prior to 1902), complete with King’s Crown Inverness-shire Constabulary badge, which was introduced in 1902.

Mel is wearing a (Sergeant rank) ball-top helmet of Inverness Burgh Police complete with Victorian Crown Helmet Plate – which would have still have been used in 1902 while the force made the significant change to flat caps (with Coat of Arms badge), following the death of Queen Victoria in 1901.

Yours truly (as Force Historian) was approached by Supt Bruce Duncan (Area Commander) as to what involvement the force could provide, and I  suggested the presence of officers dressed in both County and Burgh Police uniforms, in view of the close relationship both forces have had with the prisons over the years.

Thankfully, the antique uniforms in my possession had all shrunk (!!) so that they no longer fitted me, so the two Community Safety Officers at Inverness volunteered (?) their services.

Constables Duncan Carmichael and Mel Fowler, garbed in authentic turn-of-the century Inverness-shire and Inverness Burgh uniforms respectively, attended at Inverness Castle on 17th October 2002 and met with two Prison Officers, also clad in period uniform, and proceeded to march a &quot;prisoner&quot; from The Castle to the &quot;new&quot; prison. 

Once up the brae into the Crown area the &quot;prisoner&quot; was transferred to a period Prison Cart, which took him the rest of the way to the &quot;new&quot; prison, still escorted by the two officers.

Duncan is wearing a shako cap (which had been in use for some years prior to 1902), complete with King’s Crown Inverness-shire Constabulary badge, which was introduced in 1902.

Mel is wearing a (Sergeant rank) ball-top helmet of Inverness Burgh Police complete with Victorian Crown Helmet Plate – which would have still have been used in 1902 while the force made the significant change to flat caps (with Coat of Arms badge), following the death of Queen Victoria in 1901.

Hard to believe that was almost ten years ago! I had only just obtained a (cheap) digital camera, which explains the small size of the photos.","false","false","false","true","false",17-OCT-02,13-MAY-12,15-NOV-11,,48,1,"20bf225373","http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6215/6346038166_204398372b_o.jpg","204398372b",4

"2301513731","Sutherland Constabulary","http://www.flickr.com/photos/conner395/2301513731/","91779914@N00","In common with most other police forces, Sutherland would have reviewed their badges upon the death of Queen Victoria. Police insignai had grown and developed from nothing durign her reign, and her demise after such a long period on the throne produced heraldic concern. Many forces had the Victorian crown on their helmet badges (as did Sutherland, albeit a wee one atop the wildcat rather than a huge one on top of the whole badge - see my Inverness Burgh Helmet Plate for an example). Getting new badges with the King's (a.k.a. Imperial) Crown was one option, but were helmets still essential? Many a force instead opted for a revision of headgear, either the shako (kepi/peaked pillbox) or ordinary peaked cap, sicne these were already in use by the military, and cost would be considerably less.

But what to use as a cap device/badge? The Helmet plate was too large (and expensive), so the Chief Constable of Sutherland, Malcom Macdonald, would have nequired of his former force (Inverness-shire) what they were planning. The Chief of inverness-shire was of course none other than Alexander McHardy, previously Chief Constable of Sutherland, so they seem to have put their heads together and the same design was chosen by both, the only difference being the wording (County name).

Doubtless it would have been economically good sense, to combine the order for Inverness-shire's 60-odd with Sutherlands' dozen.

although many other County Police forces adopted the same basic design of badge, they were usually larger and in white-metal whereas those of Inverness-shire and Sutherland were otherwise unique in being small and of a brass/copper type of alloy metal. The detail is however exquisite.","false","false","false","true","false",01-MAR-08,13-MAY-12,01-MAR-08,,48,5,"cc655d6192","http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3268/2301513731_a13270885a_o.jpg","a13270885a",4

A moving shoe mobile has gears that rotate, and fanciful shoe sculptures, like the &quot;shoe tree&quot; and &quot;shoe horn&quot;, that move around a rectangular track.   Wall-mounted  games complete the exciting shoe shopping experience for children.  These elements were installed in 20 retail stores nationwide.  Interior designed by Elkus/Manfredi Architects.  The video of this retail store environment on YouTube proves that motion does attract people!

While cultural anthropologists trumpet the aggregated populist statement of the gum tree or the gob rock, we believe Shoe Trees soar to greater heights. 

A shoe tree starts with one dreamer, tossing his or her footwear-of-old high into the sky, to catch on an out-of-reach branch. It usually end there, unseen and neglected by others. But on rare occasions, that first pair of shoes triggers a shoe tossing cascade. Soon, teens are gathering up their old Adidas and Sauconys, families are driving out after church with Dad's Reeboks and grandma's Keds. The shoe tree blooms with polymer beauty. A work of art like this may last for generations, tracing our history by our sneakers . . . as long as the tree doesn't die.  (taken from roadsideamerica.com)

A grandmother is a little bit parent, a little bit teacher, and a little bit best friend.  ~Author Unknown


Most grandmas have a touch of the scallywag.  ~Helen Thomson

A grandmother pretends she doesn't know who you are on Halloween.  ~Erma Bombeck


My grandchild has taught me what true love means.  It means watching Scooby-Doo cartoons while American Idol  is on another channel.  ~Gene Perret


My granddaughter came to spend a few weeks with me, and I decided to teach her to sew.  After I had gone through a lengthy explanation of how to thread the machine, she stepped back, put her hands on her hips, and said in disbelief, &quot;You mean you can do all that, but you can't play my Game Boy?&quot;  ~Author Unknown


Soon I will be an old, white-haired lady, into whose lap someone places a baby, saying, &quot;Smile, Grandma!&quot; - I, who myself so recently was photographed on my grandmother's lap.  ~Liv Ullmann

"4431574808","Falcarius utahensis, pelvic girdle, at the Natural History Museum of Utah","http://www.flickr.com/photos/31867959@N04/4431574808/","31867959@N04","The pelvic girdle of Falcarius utahensis, at the Natural History Museum of Utah (at the time in George Thomas Museum of Natural History) on the campus of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, UT. Falcarius is a basal therizinosaur, a group of theropods (carnivorous dinosaurs) that evolved into herbivores with large bodies, long necks, and in some cases, massive claws on the forelimbs. And I mean truly massive... 

Another thing that is notable about therizinosaurs is their bird like pelvis. Dinosaurs can be broken up, phylogenetically, into two groups, the saurischians (which means 'lizard-pelvis'), which the sauropods and theropods belong to, and the ornithischians (which means 'bird-pelvis'), which the ceratopsians, stegosaurs, ankylosaurs, hardosaurs, etc, all belong to. The saurischians, as should be obvious by the name, have pelvises that resemble lizards, with the pubis projected forward, while the ornithischians have a backward pointing pubis*, like birds. Interestingly, the ornithischian-type pelvis actually evolved repeated among the saurischians, and birds are the major example. But therizinosaurs also evolved an ornithischian-like pelvis, with a backward pointing pubis. That's why I took this photo. As a basal therizinosaur, Falcarius represents a transition of sorts, where the pelvis is still obviously saurischian, but unlike most saurischians, the pubis is pointing almost directly downward, or ventrally, rather than forward, or anteriorly. In later therizinosaurs, the pubis will begin pointing backward, likely reflecting their new life style as grazers, rather than predators that require a more cursorial (running-lifestyle) body plan. 

*Although the ornithischian pubis does have a forward projecting process near its dorsal margin. ","false","false","false","true","false",07-MAR-10,26-JUN-12,14-MAR-10,,47,2,"dbf4137dbe","http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4011/4431574808_b73d213f2b_o.jpg","b73d213f2b",4

2008

Drawing from everyday encounters, I gather colors and textures found in my landscapes. My imagery is built through the creation and destruction of photographs and drawings with letterpress and sewing—to reference and examine the textures and topography that surround us. By combining various photographs and drawings of different spaces, a new place is constructed—one for the audience to discover and experience. Whether in the confines of a book or an installation space, I build paths with my imagery. By stripping and abstracting each element from my surroundings, I am able to review the notion of one’s relation to place.

He said they would all be paid volunteers, only part of which was true.

Herbie knew he was catering to calamity when he added two clarinet players from Carlsbad Caverns to his all Cornet cluster.  Band members were already belly-aching because Herbie himself only beat a battered bass drum.  “Why should he be the leader?” They all asked, “He can’t keep time, can’t read music and never learned to march.” 

Most vocal was valve-trombonist Loren “Lips” Lydecker, standing second from left.  He groused at every rehearsal gathering. Finally Herbie threatened to hide Loren’s trombone mute, a torn turquoise toque Loren took on tour.  No other warning was needed. Loren was silenced but never got over it. As his mother had indeed warned, his face froze that way.  He never married. And his dog ran away.

Farley “Fat-Fingers” Fortescue, top left, consistently misplaced his Sousaphone and had to march at the rear making raspberry noises with his tongue

The unrest persisted in the band however and word spread like feral felines at a fish fry.  Parade gigs came fewer and fewer. Finally Herbie and the gang were reduced to playing the Monty Python theme at the Porcine Mud Wrestling events in downtown Piedmont, Oklahoma.

The end of the dream was in sight when Herbie fell in love with one of the mud wrestling contestants and was never in another parade.  He was seen at a few county fairs however.

Brad Pitt was credited but did not appear in the picture.

<b>Got issues? Fort Wainwright's Customer Management Services has solutions</b>

Sep 9, 2010

By Sheryl Nix, Fort Wainwright PAO 

FORT WAINWRIGHT, Alaska - In a time of tough budget decisions and reduced resources and programs throughout the country, Fort Wainwright Soldiers and families are hearing &quot;yes&quot; instead of &quot;no&quot; when it comes to implementing their ideas and suggestions, particularly when it comes to Child, Youth and School Services programming.

Many Fort Wainwright community members are familiar with the Army Family Action Plan, an annual conference and their opportunity to submit issues for consideration by senior leaders all the way up to the Department of the Army. What they may not be aware of, however, is that all throughout the year, Customer Management Services, an Installation Management Command program designed to gather feedback from the Army community, processes submitted issues and concerns and presents them to the Installation Action Council for resolution here, at the local level.

Sonja Taylor, Fort Wainwright's customer service officer, said that whether community members submit an issue through the AFAP process, ICE comments or through the customer management link off of the installation website, <a href=""http://www.wainwright.army.mil"" rel=""nofollow"">www.wainwright.army.mil</a>, the goal is to find real solutions for Soldiers and families.

&quot;Our intent is to find resolution and find a way to get it done and bring the issues to the attention of specific programs or whoever has the ability to make the difference,&quot; Taylor said. This often can happen at the local level meaning much quicker results for Soldiers and families.

An example of this is the recent resolution of an issue requesting evening and weekend programming for infants and toddlers through CYSS.

&quot;Several similar issues about evening and weekend infant and toddler programming came in through the Army Family Action Plan process and since they were local issues, I presented the issues to the Installation Action Council,&quot; she explained.

The result was matching the issue with new and innovative programming through the Schools of Knowledge, Inspiration, Exploration and Skills Unlimited program and CYSS parent and community education programming.

SKIES Unlimited launched weekend and evening classes this month for infants, toddlers and preschoolers on a wide range of topics from parent and child sign language to music and art. The program also offers after school classes for school-age children including introduction to sewing, cooking and nutrition and knitting and crochet classes.

The CYSS parent and community education program also offers evening and weekend classes including the popular Cuddle Cure class, which teaches parents how to soothe their infant and stop the crying; CPR and first aid; Conquering the Terrible Twos; adult and youth babysitter's course and a class on making homemade baby food.&quot;We took the time to revamp the (SKIES) program so we had (classes) for infants and toddlers,&quot; said Gerri Withers, CYSS parent and outreach services director. &quot;We really listen to parents about what they're looking for.

'Who's doing it?' they say.
Parents take their children to see it.  It's like something from a story.  Sometimes people make a wish, as if it has magic properties.' &quot;

A partir de allí, llegué a un <a href=""http://www.ne.jp/asahi/fickle/flickers/noguchi/menu.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">meme con billetes</a> y posteriormente a un video ilustrativo de <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HPqe5khbg"" rel=""nofollow"">como hacer origami con un billete</a>.

El único billete que tenía a la mano en aquel entonces fue uno de $2.000, el cual es de plástico, más rígido y difícil de manipular (el morado).  Fue el único que hice viendo el video, el resto simplemente intentando a qué podía llegar.    Aunque el incoveniente mayor es la cabeza de nuestra poetiza Gabriela Mistral que en el antiguo billete de $5.000 es demasiado grande con respecto al tamaño del billete.

Requiere poco tiempo, es simple y relajante.  Cuando me tomo un descanso y hago uno, me recuerdo de Blade Runner y el unicornio.

A while ago I read a note published in the blog the <a href=""http://www.makezine.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Make</a> magazine, which was entitled  «<a href=""http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2009/11/money_hats.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Money hats</a>» (thanks to Daniel Serpell), with several heads in banknotes with hats.

From there I got to a <a href=""http://www.ne.jp/asahi/fickle/flickers/noguchi/menu.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">money's meme</a> and later to a video about <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5HPqe5khbg"" rel=""nofollow"">how to do an origami with a banknote</a>.

At that time I only had a Ch$2.000 one (Chilean pesos), which is made of plastic, more rigid and hard to handle (the purple one).  It was the only one I made while watching the video, the other ones I made them simply through trial and error.   The major inconvenience was the head of our poetry Gabriela Mistral in the old Ch$5.000 banknote, it is too big with respect to the banknote itself.

It require just a bit of time and it is simple and relaxing.  When I take a break and make one, I recall the unicorn in the movie Blade Runner.","false","false","false","true","false",23-DEC-09,11-MAR-11,23-DEC-09,,7,4,"fd89b663a1","http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4056/4207206879_56b1a7f464_o.jpg","56b1a7f464",4

First, someone has to tell Tony that sitting on a dead person's final resting place is a bit strange. 

Beyond that, this is a guy with three first names, Chester Alan Arthur. Could have been Arthur Chester Alan........or any other combination. Odd.

Third Tony seems to think people are interested in obscure Presidents. He even has some &quot;Junior Misfit&quot; guy - or is it a familiar looking dog - involved!

Arthur - or Chester - was a better-than-average President who was a fairly honest man, despite coming out of the New York State political machine. 

I think he had great whiskers, although they might look strange with me on his head!

From wiki:

Dignified, tall, and handsome, with clean-shaven chin and side-whiskers, Chester A. Arthur &quot;looked like a President.&quot;

The son of a Baptist preacher who had emigrated from northern Ireland, Arthur was born in Fairfield, Vermont, in 1829. He was graduated from Union College in 1848, taught school, was admitted to the bar, and practiced law in New York City. Early in the Civil War he served as Quartermaster General of the State of New York.

President Grant in 1871 appointed him Collector of the Port of New York. Arthur effectively marshalled the thousand Customs House employees under his supervision on behalf of Roscoe Conkling's Stalwart Republican machine.

Honorable in his personal life and his public career, Arthur nevertheless was a firm believer in the spoils system when it was coming under vehement attack from reformers. He insisted upon honest administration of the Customs House, but staffed it with more employees than it needed, retaining them for their merit as party workers rather than as Government officials.

In 1878 President Hayes, attempting to reform the Customs House, ousted Arthur. Conkling and his followers tried to win redress by fighting for the renomination of Grant at the 1880 Republican Convention. Failing, they reluctantly accepted the nomination of Arthur for the Vice Presidency.

During his brief tenure as Vice President, Arthur stood firmly beside Conkling in his patronage struggle against President Garfield. But when Arthur succeeded to the Presidency, he was eager to prove himself above machine politics.

Avoiding old political friends, he became a man of fashion in his garb and associates, and often was seen with the elite of Washington, New York, and Newport. To the indignation of the Stalwart Republicans, the onetime Collector of the Port of New York became, as President, a champion of civil service reform. Public pressure, heightened by the assassination of Garfield, forced an unwieldy Congress to heed the President.

In 1883 Congress passed the Pendleton Act, which established a bipartisan Civil Service Commission, forbade levying political assessments against officeholders, and provided for a &quot;classified system&quot; that made certain Government positions obtainable only through competitive written examinations. The system protected employees against removal for political reasons.

Acting independently of party dogma, Arthur also tried to lower tariff rates so the Government would not be embarrassed by annual surpluses of revenue. Congress raised about as many rates as it trimmed, but Arthur signed the Tariff Act of 1883. Aggrieved Westerners and Southerners looked to the Democratic Party for redress, and the tariff began to emerge as a major political issue between the two parties.

The Arthur Administration enacted the first general Federal immigration law. Arthur approved a measure in 1882 excluding paupers, criminals, and lunatics. Congress suspended Chinese immigration for ten years, later making the restriction permanent.

Arthur demonstrated as President that he was above factions within the Republican Party, if indeed not above the party itself.

"4135433566","James Buchanan Grave / The Peace Hat","http://www.flickr.com/photos/tonythemisfit/4135433566/","22714323@N06","Tony is always picking on poor old James Buchanan, who he says was the SECOND worst President. He likes to take me along on his trips - but sometimes I find myself sitting on top of a grave instead of a head! We went to beautiful Lancaster County, Amish country, for &quot;The Late Great Jimmy B&quot;. Here's some information about him - the President just before Abe Lincoln........

President (1857 - 1861), considered one of the worst ever, always rated at or near the bottom of the list of Presidents. 

Fom wiki:

James Buchanan, Jr. (April 23, 1791 – June 1, 1868) was the 15th President of the United States from 1857–1861 and the last to be born in the 18th century. To date he is the only President from the state of Pennsylvania and the only president to remain a lifelong bachelor.

A popular and experienced politician prior to his presidency, Buchanan represented Pennsylvania in the House of Representatives and later the Senate, and served as Secretary of State under President James K. Polk. After turning down an offer for an appointment to the Supreme Court, he served as Minister to the United Kingdom under President Franklin Pierce, in which capacity he helped draft the inflammatory Ostend Manifesto, which suggested the U.S. should declare war if Spain refused to sell Cuba. The Ostend Manifesto was never acted upon and greatly damaged the Pierce administration.

Despite unsuccessfully seeking the Democratic presidential nomination several times, Buchanan's nomination in the election of 1856 was a compromise between the two sides of the slavery issue and occurred while he was away on business. His subsequent election was largely due to the even more divided state of the opposition. As President he was a &quot;doughface&quot;, a Northerner with Southern sympathies who battled with Stephen A. Douglas for the control of the Democratic Party. Buchanan's efforts to maintain peace between the North and the South alienated both sides, and as the Southern states declared their secession in the prologue to the American Civil War, Buchanan's opinion was that secession was illegal, but that going to war to stop it was also illegal; hence, he remained inactive. By the time he left office, popular opinion had turned against him, and the Democratic Party had split in two. His handling of the crisis preceding the Civil War has led to his consistent ranking by historians as one of the worst Presidents in American history.","false","false","false","true","false",07-NOV-09,04-DEC-09,26-NOV-09,,20,10,"f1b48019d2","http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2497/4135433566_3f60af1d3d_o.jpg","3f60af1d3d",4

First, however, let me tell you about Tony and his &quot;graves&quot;. He uses them primarily as a (hopefully interesting) visual tool to share history with others on flickr. He is trying to add some photos and details to provide important background. You'll see &quot;Junior Misfit&quot; (LG and me) as another flickr site from which he can post the photos and comments)

We've been together since 2003 so we are old friends now. He takes me everywhere so I put up with his eccentricities!!!! 

About Bobby Kennedy:

Robert Francis &quot;Bobby&quot; Kennedy (November 20, 1925–June 6, 1968), also called RFK, was an American politician. From 1961 to 1964, he was United States Attorney General. From 1965 until his assassination in 1968, Kennedy was a US Senator from New York. He was President John F. Kennedy's younger brother and acted as one of his advisers during his presidency. For nine months after his brother John was assassinated in November 1963, Kennedy served as Attorney General under President Lyndon B. Johnson. In September 1964, however, Kennedy resigned as attorney general to seek the Senate seat, and within a few years was involved in a public disagreement with Johnson over the Vietnam War.

In early 1968, Kennedy began a campaign for president and tried to be nominated as candidate by the Democratic Party; in the California primary, Kennedy defeated Sen. Eugene McCarthy (D-Minnesota). However, on June 5, 1968, Kennedy was shot and died a day later. On June 9, President Johnson assigned security staff to all Presidential candidates and declared an official day of national mourning in response to the public grief following Kennedy's death.

Robert Kennedy (1925 - 1968) is buried at Arlington National Cemetery, near his brother, President John F. Kennedy.

Time flys, or is it simply vacuumed away. Why did I say vacuuming? Well, grandson vacuumed out my studio today after church. He and the granddaughters help us with our chores that sometimes become too toiling, thus a blessing.

The one thing most people past 60 think about most is probably age and getting older, yet it is the one subject most folks past 60 rarely speak about.

Age becomes a subject that is verboten, hidden behind our psyche. While there are a few who say &quot;you are only as old as you feel&quot;, that can sometimes be pretty old. 

Ten years ago, I could run as fast as my grandson. Now, it is impossible. However, I do have the ability to remember the joy of running. I must be thankful for the memory. There are those who can run, but remember very little, if anything, about their runs.","false","false","false","true","false",12-AUG-09,11-APR-12,12-FEB-12,,9,6,"5913b974a4","http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7066/6863981133_b1d66549cb_o.jpg","b1d66549cb",4

231. Άγαλμα της θεάς Θέμιδος. Μάρμαρο πεντελικό. Βρέθηκε στον Ραμνούντα Αττικής, μέσα στο μικρό ναό της Νεμεσεως. Η θεά φορεί ψηλά ζωσμένο χιτώνα, πλούσια πτυχωμένο ιμάτιο και σανδάλια.

Το κεφάλι είναι ένθετο και το δεξί χέρι ήταν πρόσθετο από ξεχωριστό κομμάτι μαρμάρου. Η Θέμις, κόρη του Ουρανού και της Γης, ήταν θεά της δικαιοσύνης και στον Ραμνούντα λατρευόταν στον ίδιο ναό με τη Νέμεση. Στην πρόσθιο όψη του βάθρου υπάρχει επιγραφή σύμφωνα με την οποία το άγαλμα, το οποίο φιλοτέχνησε ο Χαιρέστρατος από τον Ραμνούντα, ήταν αφιέρωμα του Μεγακλέους στη θέμιδα. Γύρω στο 300 π.Χ.

Marble statue of a woman wearing a chiton and himation. She holds a pedum, a stick associated with the god Pan. Her body is clearly seen through the thin garments that she wears. The separately carved head is ancient but does not belong. The hair is encircled with a vine wreath, although most of the leaves are restored. Part of the nose, arms and drapery are restored. The carving of the back is less detailed than at the front which is meticulously modelled. The statue may have originally represented a young goddess or heroine. The head was perhaps from a statue of a Maenad. The figure is now identified as the Muse of Comedy Thalia, although the original identifications are elusive.","false","false","false","true","false",18-JUN-11,26-JUL-11,21-JUN-11,,5,0,"241d529296","http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2580/5856620577_ce0bb14d3c_o.jpg","ce0bb14d3c",4

<i>Ce Bouddha Sâkyamuni, taillé dans le schiste, la matière spécifique de la région de l’ancien royaume du Gandhâra (Afghanistan, Pakistan), montre la double influence de l’art hellénique et de l’art indien. Le drapé de la robe monastique s’apparente à celui de l'himation grecque, tandis que les cheveux bouclés, l’allongement des oreilles et le chignon (usnisa) sont des signes distinctifs de l’art bouddhique.

The Venus Pudica in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens, Greece (# 3524) is a statue of Aphrodite, dating from the 2nd century AD, in Parian marble, found at Baiae in Southern Italy. It formerly belonged to the collection of Lord Hope and was donated to the National Museum by M. Embeirikos in 1924.

The neck, head and right arm were restored by the famous Italian sculptor Antonio Canova (1757-1822).

Aphrodite is depicted standing, nude save for a richly draped himation which she retains with her left hand in front of her pudenda. Roman version made in the 2nd century AD of the type of the Syracuse Aphrodite, the original of which goes back to the 4th century BC.

La korè - littéralement &quot;jeune fille&quot; en grec - est avec son pendant masculin, le kouros, le type même de la sculpture grecque archaïque. Sur l'Acropole d'Athènes, au VIe siècle avant notre ère, ces statues de jeunes gens sont dédiées à Athéna, la déesse de la cité.

Les statues de korès adoptent une attitude conventionnelle. Vêtues le plus souvent à la mode ionienne, elles présentent l'offrande d'un fruit, d'un vase ou d'un oiseau. Mais chaque sculpture se révèle exceptionnelle, individualisée par le style de l'artiste et le moment de sa création au cours de l'évolution de la sculpture archaïque.

La Korè de Lyon est caractéristique de ce type statuaire. Droite, majestueuse, la carrure puissante, la jeune fille serre l'offrande d'un oiseau contre son buste. La rigidité plastique du modèle est tempérée par la richesse de l'ornementation ciselée et autrefois peinte. Les éléments décoratifs appartiennent au répertoire de la Grèce de l'est, les artistes étant alors fortement influencés par l'art ionien. Elle est ainsi vêtue du chiton et de l'himation ; le polos, la chevelure et les boucles d'oreilles délicatement ciselées parent son gracieux visage .

Chef d'œuvre du département des Antiquités, la Korè de Lyon conserve encore bien des mystères que la recherche scientifique tente d'éclaircir aujourd'hui.

They still live a nomadic existence, often abandoning their mud huts and settlements in search of water for themselves and their herds of cattle, goats and sheep, which are their main currency and provide for all their necessities in the way of milk, meat, clothing and utensils. The women rub ‘otjize’ over themselves, which is a mixture of butter fat, red rock powder and sap from a local tree.  It gives their bodies a glowing red colour and protects them from the sun and insects.

Himba hairstyles tell a lot about the person; identifying their social status.  For example, pre-pubescent girls wear two thick braids in front of their faces – these look like ram horns.  After puberty the braids are replaced by many strands hanging all over their heads and faces.  As she gets older the braids are lengthened and tied back, indicating that she is ready for marriage.  Once married, an ‘erembe’ (a piece of goat leather) is tied to the top of her head.  Single men wear their hair in a single braid running backwards from their crowns (called an ‘ondatu’) with the rest shaved off; two plaits if they are eligible to marry and a turban style hairdo for married men.  Often these are covered by a similar shaped hat or material.","false","false","false","true","false",10-JUL-11,20-NOV-11,26-JUL-11,,45,4,"f3c72f4b50","http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6015/5976688351_7954920819_o.jpg","7954920819",4

THE LARGE COOL STORE

The large cool store selling cheap clothes
Set out in simple sizes plainly
(Knitwear, Summer Casuals, Hose,
In browns and greys, maroon and navy)
Conjures the weekday world of those

Who leave at dawn low terraced houses
Timed for factory, yard and site.
But past the heaps of shirts and trousers
Spread the stands of Modes For Night:
Machine-embroidered, thin as blouses,

Lemon, sapphire, moss-green, rose
Bri-Nylon Baby-Dolls and shorties
Flounce in clusters.  To suppose
They share that world, to think their sort is
Matched by something in it, shows

How separate and unearthly love is
Or women are, or what they do,
Or in our young unreal wishes
Seem to be: synthetic, new,
And natureless in exstasies.

"6860367294","Inuit Got Cancer From Paleo Diet","http://www.flickr.com/photos/ancestralhealthsymposium/6860367294/","75071497@N06","Paleolithic Inuit Autopsy results: Inuit had cancer.

01 - The inuit were confirmed to have cancer, while eating a purely native paleo diet.

02 - The inuit were riddled with carcinoma, while eating a diet consisting of natural grassfed meats.

03 - The aboriginal inuit while on their primal diet were found to have extensive bone lesions.

04 - The inuit had children with damaging birth defects while eating the paleolithic type diet.

05 - The inuit were found to have given birth to a child with downs syndrome (sloped forehead, demented) while on paleo diet

06 - Inuit bodies were found stricken with perthes disease, a wasting disease causing disintegration of the leg bone (hip), and may have gone limp. Potential osteoporosis from animal protein based diet.

07 - A woman, following the traditional primal solution diet, was potentially infected with severe breast cancer.

08 - The inuit cancer in the woman had metasticized and spread throughout her body in multiple lesions while eating paleo &quot;caveman&quot; type diet.

09 - All of the individual's teeth had fallen out, while eating paleo, and appeared to be infected with gum disease.

10 - While on the meat based paleo diet, they got infected with pinworms - small parasites living in their abdomen,  and colon, often sourced from ingesting meat. Eating meat from native wild animals can lead to gut parasite infestations.

11 - All of the paleo inuit meat-eaters were teeming with head lice - nits. As well as egg-larvae. 


Thus, the inuit are now confirmed to have cancer, birthdefects, bone wastage, meat parasites, and lice.

The inuit grew tumours and cancer all during the time they were eating a primal native paleolithic diet. Their child suffered being born with stunted brain function and genetic abnormalities. 

Note that there have been numerous claims that inuit don't get cancer, or don't have any cancer. Then when it is revealed that the inuit indeed not only get cancer, but the inuit have some of the highest rates of cancers on earth, the next thing you may encounter is another incorrect claim that for some reason this effect is only recent, that the inuit somehow got cancer now, but they didn't before, and just &quot;started&quot; getting cancer supposedly only after they started eating a Western diet(wrong). This is false. 

Please note that every one of these inuit are BEFORE all western contact. 

In other words, they got cancer eating a paleo diet, and they were not eating a Western style diet. 

In fact, all the individuals above are from 5 centuries ago. They all existed at a time before there was contact from any Westerner so no caucasion or western person could have even introduced any such western processed foods, or grain, or carbs, or SAD diets to these inuit individuals. These inuit got cancer while eating their original, native, aboriginal, natural, traditional, paleolithic style, wild food fish and meat based diet. 

Therefore, upon presenting this information herein, any person who attempted to claim that the inuit don't get cancer, or don't have cancer, or don't get cancer, or don't get cancer on their inuit diet, or only got cancer after western contact, or only started getting cancer after they started eating western diet foods, don't get sick, or only got cancer after eating plants, or only after they began eating carbs, or modern diets is summarily debunked. 

Any individual, any paleo book author, or blog commenter who may write that consuming fish, fish oil, or a paleo style diet stops cancer, prevents cancer, cures cancer, or that individuals on native diets never got cancer, or only started getting cancer after being introduced to agriculture, or processed foods, or western diets, and that ancestral native paleo diets did not result in cancer is hereby shown to be factually and scientifically incorrect.  

Autopsies confirm Inuit had cancer while on a native ancestral paleo diet.

The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) has been involved in incredible environmental outreach services since 1972.  Though they do an amazing job on their own of educating curious world citizens through their extensive and detailed website and programs, various celebrities have volunteered to stand alongside them to support their cause.

Supermodel Gisele Bundchen, and Academy Award nominee, Don Cheadle have both been appointed as ambassadors for UNEP, exuding great effort to help bring awareness and support to the important work UNEP is doing.

Loyal Studios in Santa Monica was proud to lend its studio to Bundchen and Cheadle, having had previously worked with Cheadle on a commercial in January, 2011–co-produced by Loyal Studios owner, Bob Bekian.

Their relationship continued when Cheadle formally asked Bekian to co-produce a spot for UNEP.  Bekian happily donated his Santa Monica facility and production services, equipment, and crew for the project in support of Cheadle and Bundchen, and their cause.

“The added bonus was working with Gisele.”  Bekian states.  “She is super cool, very down-to-earth, and genuinely a nice person.”   The shoot ran flawlessly, and everyone enjoyed the experience of working with such incredibly talented and kind artists.  “Our goal is to make professional production fun,” Bekian says, “and we want to do our part to help our world become a better place.”

The UNEP’s mission statement is, “To provide leadership and encourage partnership in caring for the environment by inspiring, informing, and enabling nations and peoples to improve their quality of life without compromising that of future generations.”

Gisele, Don Cheadle, and Loyal Studios are focused on putting the word out on the importance of caring about what we use our Earth for, while working in conjunction with our natural ecosystems to create a sustainable green economy.

Un secteur encore nouveau et très peu peuplé en 1907; plusieurs lots sans construction. À noter, le tracé brisé des rues à la hauteur de Isabeau Street (Jean-Talon) et 29th Street (De Castelnau), encore remarquable aujourd'hui.

Jean Genet died in Larache. He loved this city more than any other in the world. He loved this part of the port where life is so intense and where he met young guys.

Jean Genet was not a sympathetic guy but is still a great writer.

He said 'Writing is a means to bringing about the end of censorship...

The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) has been involved in incredible environmental outreach services since 1972.  Though they do an amazing job on their own of educating curious world citizens through their extensive and detailed website and programs, various celebrities have volunteered to stand alongside them to support their cause.

Supermodel Gisele Bundchen, and Academy Award nominee, Don Cheadle have both been appointed as ambassadors for UNEP, exuding great effort to help bring awareness and support to the important work UNEP is doing.

Loyal Studios in Santa Monica was proud to lend its studio to Bundchen and Cheadle, having had previously worked with Cheadle on a commercial in January, 2011–co-produced by Loyal Studios owner, Bob Bekian.

Their relationship continued when Cheadle formally asked Bekian to co-produce a spot for UNEP.  Bekian happily donated his Santa Monica facility and production services, equipment, and crew for the project in support of Cheadle and Bundchen, and their cause.

“The added bonus was working with Gisele.”  Bekian states.  “She is super cool, very down-to-earth, and genuinely a nice person.”   The shoot ran flawlessly, and everyone enjoyed the experience of working with such incredibly talented and kind artists.  “Our goal is to make professional production fun,” Bekian says, “and we want to do our part to help our world become a better place.”

The UNEP’s mission statement is, “To provide leadership and encourage partnership in caring for the environment by inspiring, informing, and enabling nations and peoples to improve their quality of life without compromising that of future generations.”

Gisele, Don Cheadle, and Loyal Studios are focused on putting the word out on the importance of caring about what we use our Earth for, while working in conjunction with our natural ecosystems to create a sustainable green economy.

an almost non-existing facade based on scaffolding, placed in one of the most desolate corners of new copenhagen neighbourhood ørestad which in itself is largely a collection of desolate corners, there could hardly be a stranger introduction to one of the most expensive concert halls in recent times.

but nouvel's scoop is to hint at a rich inner world, to say that the true city is inside. I have aldo van eyck's essay on labyrinthian clarity from the situationist times, issue 4, here in front of me. it could be the programmatic subtext of nouvel's concert hall even if van eyck would have been stupefied to learn just how heterogenous a single building can become when based on his famous line,

<i>for a house is a tiny city, a city a huge house.</i>

nouvel avoids repeating a single detail from major space to major space and one of the questions posed by his house in ørestad is if such complexity can be held together simply by a perimeter of blue fabric. nouvel might have answered with one of the concluding lines from van eyck,

<i>I have...found it expedient to define space simply as the appreciation of it, thus excluding all frozen properties attributed to it academically</i>.","false","false","false","true","false",11-FEB-09,17-OCT-11,21-MAY-09,,24,8,"134ec3f104","http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3620/3551308148_3bd814e444_o.jpg","3bd814e444",4

Hommage à René Clair:
Ma Femme est une Sorcière
Tribute to René Clair: I Married a Witch

by Jean Cocteau (French, 1889-1963)

Born into a wealthy Parisian family, Cocteau was at once a poet, novelist, playwright, librettist, screenwriter, and director, as well as a proficient artist. The consummate dilettante, he was always present in the social, artistic, and literary circles of Paris. Of the artists who designed sets for the &quot;Théȃtre de la Mode,&quot; both Cocteau and Christian Bérnard began their artistic careers with Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. Cocteau worked on numerous movies during World War II, and in 1945, when asked to create a set for the &quot;Théȃtre de la Mode,&quot; he decided to pay homage to the most French film-maker of the period, René Clair, using as his inspiration the picture &quot;Ma Femme est une sorcière.&quot; Of all the décors designed for the &quot;Théȃtre de la Mode,&quot; only Cocteau's conjures an image of war or, more generally, of destruction. In his &quot;Journal 1942-1945,&quot; in his entry for February 12, 1945, Cocteau describes his maquette, clearly the most contemporary, orginal, and least conventional set designed for the &quot;Théȃtre de la Mode.&quot;

Extract from Jean Cocteau, &quot;Journal,&quot; 1942-1945

I saw the model of my set. Fashion bores me, but I am amused by the set and fashion placed together.

It is a smoldering maid's room. One discovers an aerial view of Paris through the wall and ceiling holes. It creates vertigo. On the iron bed lies a fainted bride. Behind her stand several dismayed ladies. On the right, a very elegant lady washes her hands in a flophouse basin. Through the unhinged door on the left, a lady enters with raised arms. Others are pushed against the walls. The vision provoking this catastrophe is a bride-witch astride a broom, flying through the ceiling, her hair and train streaming.","false","false","false","true","false",29-AUG-10,23-MAY-11,29-AUG-10,,5,13,"2efe10f5ba","http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4096/4939364812_7f03eb4772_o.jpg","7f03eb4772",4

I found this purse at the thrift store for $8 a few weeks ago.  It still had the tags on it and it is brand new (and it doesn't have the thrift shop smell either).  Looks like someone didn't like their Christmas present!  I can put a lot of knitting projects in this bag!  I usually don't pay that much at the thrift store, but I felt like this purse was worth it.

The blue trench coat was this week's find at the shop - only $5 and it is spotless.

Charles Rennie Mackintosh (1868-1928) est un architecte, peintre et designer, né à Glasgow, qui est considéré comme un des principaux précurseurs du mouvement moderne.

Avec Margaret Macdonald, qui est devenue son épouse en 1900, son ami Herbert McNair et son épouse Frances Macdonald, la soeur de Margaret, tous issus de la &quot;Glasgow School of Art&quot;, il a constitué un groupe d'artistes très novateurs pour l'époque appelé &quot;The Four&quot;, influencé par l'Art Nouveau, le Symbolisme et par le mouvement anglais &quot;Arts and Crafts&quot;.

“Let a smile be your umbrella, and you'll end up with a face full of rain.” <b>George Carlin </b>( American stand-up Comedian, Actor and Author. b.1937)

&quot;Holding on to anger, resentment and hurt only gives you tense muscles, a headache and a sore jaw from clenching your teeth. Forgiveness gives you back the laughter and the lightness in your life.” <b>Joan Lunden</b>

======================================


LOL I know this is so different from all my previous pictures I’ve taking but I really want to reflect my personality towards my pictures.  A lot of my pictures are so dry and I really want to put some humor into it. I’m just letting you all know that I really love to laugh and joke around.  =) Laughter always helps me deal with my personal problems. I honestly don’ t like to get mad or get made at somebody because I just want to enjoy my life. BTW I MADE THIS A BIT CARTOONISH BY ACCIDENT BUT IT’S OKAY I GUESS

 But there’s a reason behind this story. When I was a kid I’ve always love watching Loony Tones , Scooby doo, inspector gadget, Thunder cats and etc; If you know what I’m talking about for those who love watching classic cartoons.  I miss those cartoons! I still enjoy watching them. My favorite cartoon is the Loony tones (I love the Road Runner and the Coyote) and so this picture is inspired from that cartoon. 

So yesterday, I realized that my filing from my tooth is all gone. Man!  I really need to go the dentist because I don’t want any cavities and stuff. My mom wants to do it in the Philippines but I don’t want to wait a year to go back…geez! That’s super long yo! I’m also hoping to get some braces to straighten my teeth after college. It’s time for teeth to get all pampered and happy =)

have a good day everyone =)","false","false","false","true","false",04-SEP-09,17-FEB-12,04-SEP-09,,8,38,"e9c85d1d71","","",4

Charles Rennie Mackintosh (1868-1928) est un architecte, peintre et designer, né à Glasgow, qui est considéré comme un des principaux précurseurs du mouvement moderne.

Avec Margaret Macdonald, qui est devenue son épouse en 1900, son ami Herbert McNair et son épouse Frances Macdonald, la soeur de Margaret, tous issus de la &quot;Glasgow School of Art&quot;, il a constitué un groupe d'artistes très novateurs pour l'époque appelé &quot;The Four&quot;, influencé par l'Art Nouveau, le Symbolisme et par le mouvement anglais &quot;Arts and Crafts&quot;.

L'exposition aborde l'impact sur la décoration intérieure des relations qu'ont entretenues les artistes de l'Ecole de Glasgow avec les industriels de l'époque. Le travail des métaux, de l'émail et du verre entre 1880 et 1920 est illustré.

Ce tableau avec celui de Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh intitulé &quot;The May Queen&quot; a été exposé à Vienne en novembre 1900 dans le pavillon de la Secession. Il a très vraisemblablement influencé Gustav Klimt lorsqu'il a peint sa frise &quot;Beethoven&quot;.

La &quot;Maison pour un amateur d'art&quot; a été reconstituée, à partir des dessins et des plans de l'architecte, peintre et designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Construite dans le parc Bellahouston, elle fait partie de l'offre culturelle de la ville de Glasgow en hommage au fondateur du &quot;Glasgow Style&quot; et à son épouse, artiste également : Margaret Macdonald.

En 1901, Charles Rennie Mackintosh a participé à un concours lancé par un magazine de design allemand : Innendekoration pour la création d'une maison destinée à un amateur d'art. Aucune contrainte n'était imposée et les artistes ont ainsi pu s'exprimer librement.

Mackintosh a été disqualifié car il n'avait pas fourni à temps le nombre de dessins attendus mais sa proposition artistique, à laquelle a contribué son épouse, a été considérée comme un chef-d'oeuvre. Les dessins ont été publiés l'année suivante mais la maison qui constitue la synthèse du &quot;Glasgow Style&quot; n'a pas été construite du vivant de son créateur.

Dans les années 80, un ingénieur de Glasgow G. Roxburgh et un architecte : Andy MacMillan ont eu l'idée de la construire en respectant scrupuleusement le projet initial. Après plusieurs années de recherche de financement et de travaux associant de nombreux artisans, artistes et enseignants de l'Ecole d'art de Glasgow (Glasgow School of Art), la maison a été ouverte au public en 1996 dans le parc municipal Bellahouston. Elle est visitable et accueille de nombreuses manifestations publiques et privées dont des mariages comme au moment où nous l'avons visitée.

The Jardin de Tulleries has many statues by Maillot, including these two.

This guy was really smart.  He made a bunch of statues of naked women and then later, folks introduced him to a woman who looked a lot like the statues.  She became his model and he painted many many many naked pictures of her (there are rooms and rooms in the Musée de Maillot).

It's like Pygmalion.

The Mitre Tavern is documented by the Melbourne City Council as being the oldest building in Melbourne.  Parts of the building date back to c 1836.

According to the plaque beside the door, its steeply pitched roof is waiting for snow which has never fallen on it, and the small windows relate to the English window tax of the 18th and 19th centuries. 

Originally a private home, its first liquor licence was issued in 1868, and it has been trading as a tavern ever since. 

The name for the Mitre 10 hardware chain originated here.  Two of the founding members were drinking at the Tavern when inspiration struck (“mitre” - for those of us not so handy - is a hardware term).","false","false","false","true","false",15-OCT-11,22-DEC-11,22-DEC-11,,10,0,"70e2d02468","http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7167/6555850683_2816db7170_o.jpg","2816db7170",4

Information from Artprize and artist about the work:
Title: Blackfoot Chief
Art form: 2-D
Medium: ballpoint pen on fabric panel
Year created: 2011
Description of work: The drawing &quot;Blackfoot Chief&quot; is a tribute to a person, and an era in American history. Preserved by the photo record (Roland Reed 1913) and archived in the Library of Congress, this chief is now honored and celebrated in contemporary art on a large scale. The ballpoint pen is a versatile tool which in this drawing describes in high detail the emotion and majesty of a real person who lived long ago. Although his name and details of his story may not have been recorded, his image and nation to which he belonged is celebrated in this drawing. Elements of his war bonnet, lines in his face reflection in his eyes and transition of light are recorded by the energized marks of the pen drawing attention to an early American highlighting a brief moment in time.

This is my latest work in a collection of drawings I began in 2009. This piece represents my best effort and growing ambition to create better and more powerful works to honor people, thoughts, and moments from history.

"3434224171","President Calvin Coolidge (""Silent Cal""), 1872 - 1933","http://www.flickr.com/photos/tonythemisfit/3434224171/","22714323@N06","An ironic nickname. Coolidge was President from 1923 - 1929. The Great Depression started just a few months after he left office.

About Coolidge:

Born in Plymouth, Vermont, on July 4, 1872, Coolidge was the son of a village storekeeper. He was graduated from Amherst College with honors, and entered law and politics in Northampton, Massachusetts. Slowly, methodically, he went up the political ladder from councilman in Northampton to Governor of Massachusetts, as a Republican. En route he became thoroughly conservative.

As President, Coolidge demonstrated his determination to preserve the old moral and economic precepts amid the material prosperity which many Americans were enjoying. He refused to use Federal economic power to check the growing boom or to ameliorate the depressed condition of agriculture and certain industries. His first message to Congress in December 1923 called for isolation in foreign policy, and for tax cuts, economy, and limited aid to farmers.

He rapidly became popular. In 1924, as the beneficiary of what was becoming known as &quot;Coolidge prosperity,&quot; he polled more than 54 percent of the popular vote.

In his Inaugural he asserted that the country had achieved &quot;a state of contentment seldom before seen,&quot; and pledged himself to maintain the status quo. In subsequent years he twice vetoed farm relief bills, and killed a plan to produce cheap Federal electric power on the Tennessee River.

The political genius of President Coolidge, Walter Lippmann pointed out in 1926, was his talent for effectively doing nothing: &quot;This active inactivity suits the mood and certain of the needs of the country admirably. It suits all the business interests which want to be let alone.... And it suits all those who have become convinced that government in this country has become dangerously complicated and top-heavy....&quot;

Coolidge was both the most negative and remote of Presidents, and the most accessible. He once explained to Bernard Baruch why he often sat silently through interviews: &quot;Well, Baruch, many times I say only 'yes' or 'no' to people. Even that is too much. It winds them up for twenty minutes more.&quot;

But no President was kinder in permitting himself to be photographed in Indian war bonnets or cowboy dress, and in greeting a variety of delegations to the White House.

Both his dry Yankee wit and his frugality with words became legendary. His wife, Grace Goodhue Coolidge, recounted that a young woman sitting next to Coolidge at a dinner party confided to him she had bet she could get at least three words of conversation from him. Without looking at her he quietly retorted, &quot;You lose.&quot; And in 1928, while vacationing in the Black Hills of South Dakota, he issued the most famous of his laconic statements, &quot;I do not choose to run for President in 1928.&quot;

By the time the disaster of the Great Depression hit the country, Coolidge was in retirement. Before his death in January 1933, he confided to an old friend, &quot;. . . I feel I no longer fit in with these times.&quot;

source: <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/calvincoolidge/"">www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/calvincoolidge/</a>

Coolidge is usually ranked about 30th (of 44) Presidents. In my opinion, he did very little and spoke even less - thus &quot;Silent Cal&quot;. Some modern interpretations portray him as a very depressed man....

Coolidge was the first President on film, though:

<a href=""http://www.pork4kids.com/AskAFarmer.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">www.pork4kids.com/AskAFarmer.aspx</a>

Q: In cold climates, does the hair on pigs thicken to provide warmth?
A: Pigs will grow more hair when it's cold outside; it may not be thicker, but there is more of it.

Q: Where does the ham come from on the pig?
A: Ham is a cured product from the hind leg of the pig.

Q: How long have people been curing bacon?
A: People have been curing meat as far back as the Roman times. 

Q: What part of the hog is bacon from?
A: Bacon comes from the side of a hog. It is often cured and then smoked.

Q: How much do baby pigs weigh when they are first born?
A: The average weight of a piglet is 3 pounds.

Q: What is the scientific name for a pig?
A: The scientific name for a domestic pig is Sus scrofa domesticus, though scientists often just use the term S. domesticus.

Q: What are the four main primal cuts of pork?
A: The primal/retail cuts are Loin, Side, Leg (which is the hind leg), and Shoulder (which is the front leg).

Q: Can pigs swim?
A: Yes, pigs can swim quite well by dog paddling!

Q: Are Chiterlins safe for a person to eat?
A: Chiterlins, also known as Chitterlings or Chitlings, are popular in Southern cooking. Chiterlings must be soaked and cleaned very well, and then they must simmer for several hours until tender. They can be served with sauce, fried, added to soups, or used for sausage casting. As long as the chiterlins are cleaned properly and cooked until tender, they are safe to eat.

Q: What do farmers feed their pigs?
A: It is important for pigs to have a healthy diet, just like it is important for kids to eat healthy foods. Most farmers feed their pigs grains like ground up corn, soybeans, wheat, and/or grain sorghum. These plants are grown by farmers in their fields. The grains are harvested, dried and ground up, so that they provide crunchy food for pigs. It would be similar to granola that humans eat. This helps the farmer give the pigs a healthy diet every day.

Q: How long do pigs usually live?
A: Sows and boars usually live about 4 to 5 years, and some may live longer than that. In fact, some pigs have lived as long as 15 years!

Q: Why do pigs like mud?
A: Pigs don't have sweat glands, so they will wallow in mud to keep cool. In hot weather, pigs that are raised outdoors will try to stay cool in the mud. Today, most pigs are raised in barns, and farmers use modern technology like water sprinklers in the barns to keep the pigs cool. The pigs are also cleaner in barns because they are protected from bad weather, like rain and snow.

Q: How many piglets are usually in one litter?
A: A female pig will have her first litter of piglets when she is about one year old. The sow is pregnant for about 4 months, and usually a sow will give birth to around 8 to 12 pigs at a time. A sow can have 2 litters each year. That means that a mother pig can give birth to over 20 piglets each year!

Q: What are the 8 major swine breeds?
A: * Yorkshire (also called Large White) * Duroc * Hampshire * Landrace * Berkshire * Spotted * Chester White * Poland China. Most market hogs are crossbreeds of two or more of these main purebred stock to take advantage of different characteristics.

Q: Do you have a chart that shows the parts of a pig and where the different cuts of pork come from?
A: A cut chart can be found on at <a href=""http://www.otherwhitemeat.com/aspx/all_about_pork/chops.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">www.otherwhitemeat.com/aspx/all_about_pork/chops.aspx</a>

Q: Where does the name &quot;Boston Butt&quot; come from, especially considering that the cut comes from the shoulder of the animal?
A: In pre-revolutionary New England and into the Revolutionary War, some pork cuts (not those of high value, like the loin and ham) were packed into casks or barrels for storage and shipment. These barrels were known as &quot;butts.&quot; In the Boston area, the cut from the hog's shoulder became known...","false","false","false","true","false",17-OCT-08,17-APR-12,25-OCT-08,,31,11,"b3e20dbfce","http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3232/2971831776_5a86f97853_o.jpg","5a86f97853",4

The US Office of Production Management had anticipatorily ordered auto production cutbacks in August 1941 to 73.5 percent of 1940 output. Shortly thereafter, the US entered World War II on December 8, just hours after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, forcing an industry-wide conversion ot the manufacture of war materials. Production was halted altogether on February 4, 1942. When the industry shut down to switch to war production, Cadillac was neck-and-neck with Packard as the leading luxury car in America.","false","false","false","true","false",15-OCT-08,27-FEB-09,19-OCT-08,,28,0,"353be1631f","http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3034/2952701621_739e2232bc_o.jpg","739e2232bc",4

&quot;Carnaval&quot; was my one of my favorite times of year in Caracas, Venezuela.

We lived near Plaza Altamira, which had a large reflecting pool.  During Carnaval, the pool would be drained.  Kids in Carnaval costimes or masks would flock to Plaza Altamira with their parents and/or nannies for the thrill of chasing each other around with confetti.  It was a blast.  

In 1960, I went in a war bonnet.

(1) It looks like there is room for another two cards - why not go the whole hog and leave out the money clip in favour of another couple of card spaces.

(2) The card slots have one corner cut off. This makes it clear what they are for, but if they were squared off, there would be the option of turning the card round. Why? Well that way, you could distinguish between empty cards and full ones without having to put them in your camera.","false","false","false","true","false",29-MAY-11,29-MAY-11,29-MAY-11,,2,0,"1a7c9bf500","http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5310/5772750017_1f026bd398_o.jpg","1f026bd398",4

I had no idea back then that a Grade II* listed building was at the end of the road.

Gun Barrel Proof House is Grade II* listed.

A gun barrel proof (testing) house commissioned by the Guardians of the Birmingham Gun Barrel Proof House from John Horton and opened in 1813. The building was added to by Charles Edge in 1860, Bateman and Corser in 1868-70 and again in 1876, and by Jethro Cossins in 1883.
MATERIALS: The building is of red brick laid in a variety of bonds with painted stone and terracotta dressings and a slate and plain tiled roof.
PLAN: The original building of 1813 has two storeys and a basement and lies to north of the site. To its north is an entrance forecourt which has a gate screen and two-storey lodge to the west. At south is a yard which contains the single-storey proof rooms and magazine and loading rooms.
The buildings all abut each other or are joined by covered walkways, but they are described here separately for clarity.
THE ENTRANCE RANGE FROM BANBURY STREET of 1883 has a central round arch set in a shaped gable. This was raised in 1970 to accommodate larger vehicles. At either side are shaped gables, that at left belonging to the gate lodge. The diapered brick work has moulded brick dressings and there is a stone tympanum to the central arch which shows the coat of arms set in a cartouche. The south flank of the entrance lodge is of three bays, with a central two-storey porch with shaped gable.
THE PROOF HOUSE RANGE OF 1813 is joined to the entrance range and the furthest right hand bay of its north face is masked by the block to south of the arch. EXTERIOR: The 1813 front has ten bays and is of Flemish bond brick. To near-centre is the principal door, which was formerly a throughway. This has a frontispiece which has a basket arch with Tuscan pillars to either side and an entablature with blocking course. Projecting from the blocking course is a tablet supported on brackets which reads `ESTABLISHED BY ACT OF PARLIAMENT / FOR PUBLIC SECURITY, ANNO DOM : 1813.' Above this is a broad, shallow niche which contains an elaborate trophy of arms (attributed to William Hollins) and to the top is a segmental pediment with a circular clock face. To either side of this feature are rainwater pipes with hoppers which each have the date `1813'. To left of this are five bays, and to right are four bays, of a former eleven-bay composition. Both floors have painted stone surrounds to the windows with brackets supporting segmental pediments. Between the first and second bays at left is the Guardians' entrance which leads up to the Board Room at first floor level. This has a six-panelled door with fanlight and Tuscan doorcase with open, segmental pediment. Until 1868 there was a matching doorway at right of centre which gave access to two houses of proof house officials. The south face of this range, which fronts the yard has numerous additions.

Oktober 1926 zusammen mit Hugo Greffenius, Hauptaktionär der MIAG, die Röhr Auto AG. Zusammen hatten beide ein Startkapital von ca. 500.000 Reichsmark. Im selben Jahr wurde das Gelände der Falcon Automobilwerke in Ober-Ramstadt übernommen. Im Herbst 1927 begann die Produktion des Röhr 8, dem der 1928 in Berlin erstmals der Öffentlichkeit vorgestellte Röhr 8 Typ R folgte. Das Fahrzeug war ein wirtschaftlicher Erfolg und man erreichte im selben Jahr einen Auftragsbestand von 2.200 Röhr-Wagen. Röhr beschäftigte 1929 etwa 800 Mitarbeiter. 1930 während der Weltwirtschaftskrise, mussten die „Röhr Auto AG“ Konkurs anmelden.

Anfang 1931 stoppte die Produktion vorerst. Die Röhr Auto AG wurde mit Einverständnis der Gläubiger vom schweizerischen Röhr-Generalvertreter Joos Andreas Heintz übernommen. Unter dem Namen Neue Röhr AG wurde im April 1931 die Produktion wieder aufgenommen, Hans Gustav Röhr verließ sein Unternehmen jedoch. Im Frühjahr 1932 wurde als neues Modell der Röhr Junior vorgestellt.

Die Machtergreifung der Nationalsozialisten und deren anschließende Repressalien gegenüber jüdischem Kapital schwächten die Röhr AG nachhaltig. Im Dezember 1934 musste deswegen erneut Konkurs angemeldet werden. Die Werkstätten in Ober-Ramstadt wurden im Frühjahr 1935 geschlossen. Sämtliche Fertigungsunterlagen und Werkzeuge standen zum Verkauf. Stoewer sicherte sich die Produktionsrechte am Röhr Junior und fertigte ihn als Stoewer Greif Junior bis 1939. Der Rest ging zunächst an die Gesellschaft für die Verwertung von Industrieanlagen mbH, die bis 1936 noch einige Röhr F bauen ließ. Schließlich pachtete die Noll-Monnard KG die Räume der vormaligen Reparaturabteilung und überarbeitete den Röhr F nochmals, jedoch ohne die Produktion beginnen zu können. Im Sommer 1937 wurden die Bemühungen endgültig eingestellt.

Universal Time is the official measurement of change. The clock is personal for every woman. This personal change is different for every woman, tree, planet, star and galaxy. The watch on a dry leaf represents decay, change and the transience of everything. There is no eternal stability, even the change is not stable, because every galaxy has it's own entropy, speeds and measurements.

Time can be used as replacement for money, if two women agree to exchange time credits for services or goods. Teenagers stopped using analog wrist watches around the disruptive year of 2001, because they started using beautiful mobile phones to look up the current times and entertainment trends.

There are over 56 different time zones on earth. Funny countries love to shift their clocks from winter to summer time, on the last Sunday of March, because there is more sunshine hours in the summer. This funny joke was invented long hours ago, when radical men did not have enough electricity and no practical LED lights in their village huts. They tried to save candles by shifting their clocks, instead of changing schedules. The problem with this is that the natural body clock and the natural seasonal differences in the northern regions were not considered important in that age of radical change. So every half a year, modern women in the north have to suffer for a week to overcome the sudden disruption of sleep, waking up and going to bed. Children and old people suffer the most from the shifting of the clocks.

After the shifting, the official seconds of the GMT time are less precise and more prone to errors than the Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) seconds. The UTC can be used to coordinate the global countdown on the new years eve. It is also possible to experience a repetitive new years eve every hour by flying in a fast rocket time machine, that is flying through global time zones around the earth. The rocket can fly into the future or the past, but only within 12 hours of an earth day. The same traveling rocket can not be twice in the same space-time of earth.

They then migrate again in the middle of the wet season, moving once more from the tributaries upstream into the nutrient-rich rivers, where they may enter many different tributaries. They continue this activity until the water level drops. When it rises once more the fish spawn again in the mouth of the tributary they are currently in.

Interestingly it appears that older fish do not undertake these migrations, as reported by Ribeiro and Petrere (1990). They did not suggest an age limit for migration but did note that non-migratory fish were much larger than the migrating individuals and tend to occur further up the tributaries.

This species is distinguishable from the very similar S. insignis  by the presence of dark spots on the sides that do not fade as the fish matures. Young S. insignis  also exhibit these spots but they disappear with age.

2011-09-17-Coastal-Cleanup-Morro-Bay-Sandspit-NEP
33 Photos documenting this event.  Here is the call to volunteer:  Coastal Cleanup Day (CCD), Saturday, September 17, 2011.  Following are the details for the sandspit crews. Please meet at the north t-pier, by the Harbor Dept..and Coast Guard offices (approximately 1275 Embarcadero) at 8:30.  Annie and Anna (from Morro Bay National Estuary Program, NEP), site captains, will go over a few details about the site, handle waivers and everyone will board boats by 9 a.m.  
As you hopefully know by now, there are no facilities on the sand spit. We'll be walking a loop of approximately one mile, in soft sand. You'll want to bring water, sunscreen and/or hat, and wear shoes that are comfortable in soft sand (that can get wet - you may get a bit wet getting on and off the boats), as well as gloves if you have them. Please be prepared to carry anything you bring as we will not necessarily be departing from the drop-off location. Additionally, please remember that we do our best to get volunteers back to their vehicles by noon, but we are subject to Harbor Dept. schedule. Should there be an emergency, we could be delayed.  
Again, this year CCD is making efforts not to create additional waste while cleaning beaches and creeks. We have some buckets for transporting debris. If you'd wish to bring your own reusable container as well, you are welcome to do so. As I already mentioned, please bring gloves if you have them. We will have disposable gloves if you need them. 
Should you find you cannot make it or need to contact someone on Saturday, please call Annie at (805)540-0861. Please be sure to notify Annie if you cannot make it so the crews aren't waiting for you.  Thank you all for your participation!

In 1830, the British explorer Richard Lander encountered mothers carrying carved wooden figures, which he understood were little memorials. It is now known that ere ibeji are Yoruba memorials to twins who have died. Twins are believed to be the children of Shango, the god of thunder and lightning. They are also thought to possess supernatural powers and share the same soul. A memorial figure serves as a receptacle for half of the shared soul. Although representing deceased infants or children, ere ibeji depict them as adults in the prime of life. Each figure is dressed and adorned according to the gender, social status and religious affiliation of the twin for whom it stands. The mother of a departed twin carries an ere ibeji tucked in her wrapper and treats it as a live infant in the belief that to deny twins--Shango's children--is to court their wrath. Thus, to forestall grave misfortune, the sculptures are bathed, rubbed with oil, clothed and adorned. They are kept in the family's twin altar or in a gourd container with paraphernalia used in Shango worship.","false","false","false","true","false",28-SEP-08,06-MAY-09,06-OCT-08,,9,0,"0c438c71cd","http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3030/2916962069_595fba5094_o.jpg","595fba5094",4

33 Photos documenting this event.  Here is the call to volunteer:  Coastal Cleanup Day (CCD), Saturday, September 17, 2011.  Following are the details for the sandspit crews. Please meet at the north t-pier, by the Harbor Dept..and Coast Guard offices (approximately 1275 Embarcadero) at 8:30.  Annie and Anna (from Morro Bay National Estuary Program, NEP), site captains, will go over a few details about the site, handle waivers and everyone will board boats by 9 a.m.  
As you hopefully know by now, there are no facilities on the sand spit. We'll be walking a loop of approximately one mile, in soft sand. You'll want to bring water, sunscreen and/or hat, and wear shoes that are comfortable in soft sand (that can get wet - you may get a bit wet getting on and off the boats), as well as gloves if you have them. Please be prepared to carry anything you bring as we will not necessarily be departing from the drop-off location. Additionally, please remember that we do our best to get volunteers back to their vehicles by noon, but we are subject to Harbor Dept. schedule. Should there be an emergency, we could be delayed.  
Again, this year CCD is making efforts not to create additional waste while cleaning beaches and creeks. We have some buckets for transporting debris. If you'd wish to bring your own reusable container as well, you are welcome to do so. As I already mentioned, please bring gloves if you have them. We will have disposable gloves if you need them. 
Should you find you cannot make it or need to contact someone on Saturday, please call Annie at (805)540-0861. Please be sure to notify Annie if you cannot make it so the crews aren't waiting for you.  Thank you all for your participation!

If you'd wish to bring your own reusable container as well, you are welcome to do so. As I already mentioned, please bring gloves if you have them. We will have disposable gloves if you need them. 
Should you find you cannot make it or need to contact someone on Saturday, please call Annie at (805)540-0861. Please be sure to notify Annie if you cannot make it so the crews aren't waiting for you.  Thank you all for your participation!

33 Photos documenting this event.  Here is the call to volunteer:  Coastal Cleanup Day (CCD), Saturday, September 17, 2011.  Following are the details for the sandspit crews. Please meet at the north t-pier, by the Harbor Dept..and Coast Guard offices (approximately 1275 Embarcadero) at 8:30.  Annie and Anna (from Morro Bay National Estuary Program, NEP), site captains, will go over a few details about the site, handle waivers and everyone will board boats by 9 a.m.  
As you hopefully know by now, there are no facilities on the sand spit. We'll be walking a loop of approximately one mile, in soft sand. You'll want to bring water, sunscreen and/or hat, and wear shoes that are comfortable in soft sand (that can get wet - you may get a bit wet getting on and off the boats), as well as gloves if you have them. Please be prepared to carry anything you bring as we will not necessarily be departing from the drop-off location. Additionally, please remember that we do our best to get volunteers back to their vehicles by noon, but we are subject to Harbor Dept. schedule. Should there be an emergency, we could be delayed.

33 Photos documenting this event.  Here is the call to volunteer:  Coastal Cleanup Day (CCD), Saturday, September 17, 2011.  Following are the details for the sandspit crews. Please meet at the north t-pier, by the Harbor Dept..and Coast Guard offices (approximately 1275 Embarcadero) at 8:30.  Annie and Anna (from Morro Bay National Estuary Program, NEP), site captains, will go over a few details about the site, handle waivers and everyone will board boats by 9 a.m.  
As you hopefully know by now, there are no facilities on the sand spit. We'll be walking a loop of approximately one mile, in soft sand. You'll want to bring water, sunscreen and/or hat, and wear shoes that are comfortable in soft sand (that can get wet - you may get a bit wet getting on and off the boats), as well as gloves if you have them. Please be prepared to carry anything you bring as we will not necessarily be departing from the drop-off location. Additionally, please remember that we do our best to get volunteers back to their vehicles by noon, but we are subject to Harbor Dept. schedule. Should there be an emergency, we could be delayed.  
Again, this year CCD is making efforts not to create additional waste while cleaning beaches and creeks. We have some buckets for transporting debris. If you'd wish to bring your own reusable container as well, you are welcome to do so. As I already mentioned, please bring gloves if you have them. We will have disposable gloves if you need them. 
Should you find you cannot make it or need to contact someone on Saturday, please call Annie at (805)540-0861. Please be sure to notify Annie if you cannot make it so the crews aren't waiting for you.  Thank you all for your participation!

33 Photos documenting this event.  Here is the call to volunteer:  Coastal Cleanup Day (CCD), Saturday, September 17, 2011.  Following are the details for the sandspit crews. Please meet at the north t-pier, by the Harbor Dept..and Coast Guard offices (approximately 1275 Embarcadero) at 8:30.  Annie and Anna (from Morro Bay National Estuary Program, NEP), site captains, will go over a few details about the site, handle waivers and everyone will board boats by 9 a.m.  
As you hopefully know by now, there are no facilities on the sand spit. We'll be walking a loop of approximately one mile, in soft sand. You'll want to bring water, sunscreen and/or hat, and wear shoes that are comfortable in soft sand (that can get wet - you may get a bit wet getting on and off the boats), as well as gloves if you have them. Please be prepared to carry anything you bring as we will not necessarily be departing from the drop-off location. Additionally, please remember that we do our best to get volunteers back to their vehicles by noon, but we are subject to Harbor Dept. schedule. Should there be an emergency, we could be delayed.  
Again, this year CCD is making efforts not to create additional waste while cleaning beaches and creeks. We have some buckets for transporting debris. If you'd wish to bring your own reusable container as well, you are welcome to do so. As I already mentioned, please bring gloves if you have them. We will have disposable gloves if you need them. 
Should you find you cannot make it or need to contact someone on Saturday, please call Annie at (805)540-0861. Please be sure to notify Annie if you cannot make it so the crews aren't waiting for you.  Thank you all for your participation!

33 Photos documenting this event.  Here is the call to volunteer:  Coastal Cleanup Day (CCD), Saturday, September 17, 2011.  Following are the details for the sandspit crews. Please meet at the north t-pier, by the Harbor Dept..and Coast Guard offices (approximately 1275 Embarcadero) at 8:30.  Annie and Anna (from Morro Bay National Estuary Program, NEP), site captains, will go over a few details about the site, handle waivers and everyone will board boats by 9 a.m.  
As you hopefully know by now, there are no facilities on the sand spit. We'll be walking a loop of approximately one mile, in soft sand. You'll want to bring water, sunscreen and/or hat, and wear shoes that are comfortable in soft sand (that can get wet - you may get a bit wet getting on and off the boats), as well as gloves if you have them. Please be prepared to carry anything you bring as we will not necessarily be departing from the drop-off location. Additionally, please remember that we do our best to get volunteers back to their vehicles by noon, but we are subject to Harbor Dept. schedule. Should there be an emergency, we could be delayed.  
Again, this year CCD is making efforts not to create additional waste while cleaning beaches and creeks. We have some buckets for transporting debris. If you'd wish to bring your own reusable container as well, you are welcome to do so. As I already mentioned, please bring gloves if you have them. We will have disposable gloves if you need them. 
Should you find you cannot make it or need to contact someone on Saturday, please call Annie at (805)540-0861. Please be sure to notify Annie if you cannot make it so the crews aren't waiting for you.  Thank you all for your participation!

If you can measure the length of the skull as best you can determine, and of the canine teeth and send me the measurements, those should be diagnostic.

Addendum—also note whether the flippers are short (about 1/8 of body length or less) and rounded, or long (about 1/5 to 1/4 of body length) and tapered.  Note presence or absence of claws/nails on flippers if visible.

Turkey Vultures were feasting on this dead marine mammal - I’m not sure what this species this, as it is very large for a sea lion, and the head lacks a pronounced bump.

The IT Crowd has the Kozyndan poster (the wave of bunnies/Hokusai-tribute) in their office!! Isn't that awesome!

In 1830, the British explorer Richard Lander encountered mothers carrying carved wooden figures, which he understood were little memorials. It is now known that ere ibeji are Yoruba memorials to twins who have died. Twins are believed to be the children of Shango, the god of thunder and lightning. They are also thought to possess supernatural powers and share the same soul. A memorial figure serves as a receptacle for half of the shared soul. Although representing deceased infants or children, ere ibeji depict them as adults in the prime of life. Each figure is dressed and adorned according to the gender, social status and religious affiliation of the twin for whom it stands. The mother of a departed twin carries an ere ibeji tucked in her wrapper and treats it as a live infant in the belief that to deny twins--Shango's children--is to court their wrath. Thus, to forestall grave misfortune, the sculptures are bathed, rubbed with oil, clothed and adorned. They are kept in the family's twin altar or in a gourd container with paraphernalia used in Shango worship.","false","false","false","true","false",28-SEP-08,06-MAY-09,06-OCT-08,,9,0,"04e32b90f6","http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3126/2917806430_b8d466a93d_o.jpg","b8d466a93d",4

2011-09-17-Coastal-Cleanup-Morro-Bay-Sandspit-NEP
33 Photos documenting this event.  Here is the call to volunteer:  Coastal Cleanup Day (CCD), Saturday, September 17, 2011.  Following are the details for the sandspit crews. Please meet at the north t-pier, by the Harbor Dept..and Coast Guard offices (approximately 1275 Embarcadero) at 8:30.  Annie and Anna (from Morro Bay National Estuary Program, NEP), site captains, will go over a few details about the site, handle waivers and everyone will board boats by 9 a.m.  
As you hopefully know by now, there are no facilities on the sand spit. We'll be walking a loop of approximately one mile, in soft sand. You'll want to bring water, sunscreen and/or hat, and wear shoes that are comfortable in soft sand (that can get wet - you may get a bit wet getting on and off the boats), as well as gloves if you have them. Please be prepared to carry anything you bring as we will not necessarily be departing from the drop-off location. Additionally, please remember that we do our best to get volunteers back to their vehicles by noon, but we are subject to Harbor Dept. schedule. Should there be an emergency, we could be delayed.  
Again, this year CCD is making efforts not to create additional waste while cleaning beaches and creeks. We have some buckets for transporting debris. If you'd wish to bring your own reusable container as well, you are welcome to do so. As I already mentioned, please bring gloves if you have them. We will have disposable gloves if you need them. 
Should you find you cannot make it or need to contact someone on Saturday, please call Annie at (805)540-0861. Please be sure to notify Annie if you cannot make it so the crews aren't waiting for you.  Thank you all for your participation!

The view over the surrounding hills was spectacular and the car park was full of Zulu women selling wonderful soapstone pottery and objects carved out of wood and bone. I know because we never left without buying something. 
The town of Lydenburg lies behind Amy's right shoulder. I don't think we ever stopped there but it always signified the start and end of the holiday weekend. Before and after this was the 200 mile straight slog along the N3 back to Jo'burg. 
This stop was on the way home from a long weekend spent at Pilgrims Rest and God's Window.
I wanted to take my Mum to see, not just these beautiful places, but also to visit the graveyard in the town which was mainly populated with the remains of many Welsh miners from the valleys near where my Mother was born. I think these miners were looking for gold rather than the coal which is much more common in this part of the Transvaal. I don't think they found much though the town still looks much as it did in its hayday as a mining settlement.
From the viewpoint of nearby God's Window you get stunning views of the whole of the Kruger National Park.","false","false","false","true","false",15-DEC-11,23-DEC-11,16-DEC-11,,18,5,"938a3ddbbb","http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7171/6522321921_eccfdb0048_o.jpg","eccfdb0048",4

I know the inflatable Daffodil with 'Cymru am Byth'  (Wales for Ever) gives it away a bit but I had to have a word and take her picture as I had watched her walking up to many fancy dressed people to ask if she could take their picture. I noticed as well just how few said no. I asked her where in Wales she was from and she replied &quot;I'm Hilary from Pontypool.&quot; Any person, like myself, of Welsh origins has nothing to say other than &quot;oh yes, home of the legendary Pontypool Front Row that powered Wales to many Rugby victories in the late 60's, early 70's. She was impressed until I told her my name was Gareth Williams which meant to her that, of course, I would know all about them. 
Hilary was wandering about the crowd on her own so I believe her to be one of Wales's own great eccentrics. Nothing wrong with that as it was a pleasure to meet her and chat for a few minutes. All the best to you darling.

In the deep glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery.

"3797828949","William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley","http://www.flickr.com/photos/60861613@N00/3797828949/","60861613@N00","by; after; or after Henry Bone; John De Critz the Elder; Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger,drawing,December 1811

William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley (sometimes spelled Burleigh) (13 September 1520 – 4 August 1598), KG, was an English statesman, the chief advisor of Queen Elizabeth I for most of her reign (17 November 1558–24 March 1603), twice Secretary of State (1550–1553 and 1558–1572) and Lord High Treasurer from 1572.

Cecil was born in Bourne, Lincolnshire in 1520, the son of Richard Cecil, owner of the Burghley estate (near Stamford, Lincolnshire), and his wife, Jane Heckington.

Pedigrees, elaborated by Cecil himself with the help of William Camden the antiquary, associated him with the Cecils or Sitsylts of Allt-Yr-Ynys, Walterstone[1] on the border of Herefordshire and Monmouthshire, and traced his descent from an Owen of the time of King Harold and a Sitsyllt of the reign of William Rufus. Sitsylt is the original Welsh spelling of the anglicised Cecil. There is now no doubt that the family was from the Welsh Marches and Lord Burghley himself acknowledged this in his family pedigree painted at Theobalds.[2] The family had connections with Dore Abbey[3]. However, the move to Stamford provides information concerning the Lord Treasurer's grandfather, David; he, according to Burghley's enemies, kept the best inn in Stamford. David somehow secured the favour of Henry VII, to whom he seems to have been Yeoman of the Guard. He was Sergeant-of-Arms to Henry VIII in 1526, Sheriff of Northamptonshire in 1532, and a Justice of the Peace for Rutland. His eldest son, Richard, Yeoman of the Wardrobe (d. 1554), married Jane, daughter of William Heckington of Bourne, and was father of three daughters and the future Lord Burghley.

William, the only son, was put to school first at The King's School, Grantham and then at Stamford School, which he later saved and endowed. In May 1535, at the age of fourteen, he went up to St John's College, Cambridge,[4] where he was brought into contact with the foremost educators of the time, Roger Ascham and John Cheke, and acquired an unusual knowledge of Greek. He also acquired the affections of Cheke's sister, Mary, and was in 1541 removed by his father to Gray's Inn, without, after six years' residence at Cambridge, having taken a degree. The precaution proved useless and four months later Cecil committed one of the rare rash acts of his life in marrying Mary Cheke. The only child of this marriage, Thomas, the future Earl of Exeter, was born in May 1542, and in February 1543 Cecil's first wife died. Three years later, on 21 December 1546 he married Mildred, daughter of Sir Anthony Cooke, who was ranked by Ascham with Lady Jane Grey as one of the two most learned ladies in the kingdom, and whose sister, Anne, became the wife of Sir Nicholas (and the mother of Sir Francis) Bacon.

Burghley's private life seems to have been upright; he was a faithful husband, a careful father and a dutiful master. A book-lover and antiquarian, he made a special hobby of heraldry and genealogy. It was the conscious and unconscious aim of the age to reconstruct a new landed aristocracy on the ruins of the old, Catholic order. As such, Burghley was a great builder, planter and patron. All the arts of architecture and horticulture were lavished on Burghley House and Theobalds (which his son, Robert, was to exchange with James I for Hatfield House). As the Marquess of Winchester (Burghley's predecessor as Lord High Treasurer) had said of himself, Burghley was &quot;sprung from the willow rather than the oak&quot;. The interests of the State were his supreme consideration and to that end he felt no hesitation in sacrificing his conscience. He frankly disbelieved in toleration: &quot;That State...could never be in safety where there was a toleration of two religions. For there is no enmity so great as that for religion; and therefore they that differ in the service of their God can never agree in the service of their country.&q...","false","false","false","true","false",25-SEP-08,09-JUN-12,07-AUG-09,,3,0,"4db74d7133","http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3465/3797828949_dfd98f5f7a_o.jpg","dfd98f5f7a",4
"3798646330","Sir Henry Sidney, brother in law of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester","http://www.flickr.com/photos/60861613@N00/3798646330/","60861613@N00","by Unknown artist,painting,late 16th century

Sir Henry Sidney (1529 - 5 May 1586), lord deputy of Ireland, was the eldest son of Sir William Sidney of Penshurst, a prominent politician and courtier during the reigns of Henry VIII and Edward VI, from both of whom he received extensive grants of land, including the manor of Penshurst in Kent, which became the principal residence of the family.

Henry Sidney was brought up at court as the companion of Prince Edward, afterwards King Edward VI, and he continued to enjoy the favour of the Crown, particularly throughout the reign of Queen Elizabeth I.

Sidney married Mary Dudley, eldest daughter of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland in 1551. They would have three sons and four daughters. His eldest son was Sir Philip Sidney, and his second was Robert Sidney, 1st Earl of Leicester.

His daughter Mary Sidney married Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, and by reason of her literary achievements was one of the most celebrated women of her time.

In 1556 he went to Ireland with the lord deputy, Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex, who in the previous year had married his sister Frances Sidney; and from the first he had a large share in the administration of the country, especially in the military measures taken by his brother-in-law for bringing the native Irish chieftains into submission to the English Crown. In the course of the lord deputy's Ulster expedition in 1557 Sidney devastated the island of Rathlin; and during the absence of Sussex in England in the following year, Sidney was charged with the sole responsibility for the government of Ireland, which he conducted with marked ability and success. A second absence of the lord deputy from Ireland, occasioned by the accession of Queen Elizabeth, threw the chief control into Sidney's hands at the outbreak of trouble with Shane O'Neill, and he displayed great skill in temporizing with the chieftain until Sussex reluctantly returned to his duties in August 1559. About the same time Sidney resigned his office of vice-treasurer of Ireland on his appointment as president of the council of the Marches in Wales, and for the next few years he resided chiefly at Ludlow Castle, with frequent visits to the court in London.

In the autumn of 1567 Sidney returned to England, and was absent from Ireland for the next ten months. On his return he urged upon Cecil the necessity for measures to improve the economic condition of Ireland, to open up the country by the construction of roads and bridges, to replace the Ulster tribal institutions by a system of freehold land tenure, and to repress the ceaseless disorder prevalent in every part of the island. In 1569, he oversaw the opening of parliament, the first to be held for ten years.

In pursuance of this policy Sidney proposed the appointment of a military governor (&quot;Lord President&quot;) in the provinces of Munster and Connaught. This provoked the first of the Desmond Rebellions led by James Fitzmaurice Fitzgerald of the Geraldine family, which had been put down with great severity by 1573. Sidney dealt severely with the unruly Butlers in Ormond and Kilkenny, who had risen out in defiance of the government in reaction to the opportunistic claims to certain of their lands by Sir Peter Carew, a rather rough gentleman from Devon who pursued his entitlement with the blessing of the Dublin administration. At Kilkenny large numbers of Sir Edmund Butler's followers were hanged, and three brothers of Thomas Butler, 3rd Earl of Ormonde, were attainted by an act of the Irish parliament in 1570.

Sidney left Ireland in 1571, aggrieved by the slight appreciation of his statesmanship shown by the queen; but he returned in September, 1575 with increased powers and renewed tokens of royal approval, to find matters in a worse state than before, especially in Antrim, where the MacQuillans of the Route and Sorley Boy MacDonnell were the chief fomenters of disorder.

Built on the foundations of old Italian principles, Mallia was founded in the 1960’s in Toronto’s tony fashion district, Spadina Avenue.  Focusing on Wool Coats, Mallia’s Italian heritage created a new standard of excellence in the construction of The Coat, one of the most important pieces in a wardrobe.

Mallia has been designing and manufacturing coats for Canada’s largest retailers for over 40 years, including Canada’s largest department stores throughout its history.  Its years of success in business are a true testimony to the value in a Mallia coat, and the value in a brand that knows how to make a coat.

Throughout the years, Mallia’s mission is to create a wonderful product. Like a good master tailor, Mallia’s discreet imprint on the fashion world has let the product speak for itself. With its bespoke tailoring services and made-to-measure programs, the Mallia customer has always found what they are looking for, and has kept Mallia as the ‘go-to” place for coats.

Under both the Mallia brand and private label work, the Mallia coat can be found in over 400 stores across North America, including high end department stores and better boutiques throughout Canada.

"3339153543","Hinge Pin with Nosegay","http://www.flickr.com/photos/adavey/3339153543/","40595948@N00","I enjoy photographing architectural details, so as I left the 13th century rock-hewn Church of Bet Abba Libanos in Lalibela, Ethiopia, I took a picture of the interesting hardware at the top of the main door.

What I didn't see until I processed the photo today were the flowers someone wedged under one of the straps holding the hinge pin in place.  

Now, the flowers are attractive in their dry state, but I'd like to think they were a fresh nosegay when a visitor left them as a small and subtle gift to embellish one of the humblest parts of the church.

I cannot tell whether the straps are leather or metal.  It seems inconceivable that leather would be strong enough to secure the wooden hinge pin to the top of the door.  But there's something about the material's color and texture that suggests it's leather rather than metal.  I'm probably letting myself be carried away by my imagination.

But the dried flowers are as real as the ancient church itself.
===============================================================
In his Bradt Guide Ethiopia (November 2005, 4th Ed.), Phillip Briggs writes:

&quot;According to the legends, Bet Abba Libanos was built overnight by Lalibela's wife Meskel Kebre, assisted by a group of angels.&quot;

&quot;The church has been built around [sic] a cave in a vertical face, and although the roof is still connected to the original rock, the sides and back are separated from the rock by narrow tunnels.&quot;

&quot;The pink-tinged façade, which once again shows strong Axumite influences in its arched and cruciform windows, lies under an overhang in a way that is reminiscent of some churches in Tigrai.&quot;

The ritual east end is oriented to the south-east compass point and directions in this description refer to ritual orientation. The two southern aisles formed part of the original church of 1836-8. To these a chancel, north-eastern vestry and clock tower were added in 1855-7 and in 1884-5 a larger nave and chancel were attached to the south side, replacing the former south aisle.

EXTERIOR: The original church designed by J.J.Scoles was relatively simple, with a nave and aisles under separate pitched roofs and no chancel. The north aisle has six bays of lancet windows, divided by buttresses, with a simple corbel table below the parapet. There is a door to the western end of the aisle and a gabled porch to the west end. An illustration of 1847 shows the west end to have a more-elaborate gable treatment with pinnacles and a rose window (perhaps blind) and it may be that these details were removed in the bomb damage of 1943. The Charles Edge chancel of 1855-7 continues the overall style of the Scoles building with lancets to the north and east sides and on the vestry. The octagonal clock tower is set in the re-entrant angle between the north aisle and the chancel. The Chatwin nave and chancel of 1884-5 continues this pattern of respectful adaptation and its south aisle reproduces the overall pattern of the north aisle, although it is lower, to accommodate a clerestory above, which has paired lights with cusped heads. The chancel has an eastern window of five lancet lights. To its south side is the lowest stage of a planned steeple which, together with its circular staircase turret, is capped by a temporary pitched roof.

INTERIOR: The Nave and north aisle of 1836-8 remain largely intact. The nave has a panelled ceiling with two circular, metal, ventilation grilles to the centre. The tall, slender columns which divide nave from aisle consist of clusters of colonettes with waterholding moulding to the base. The mouldings to the underside of the north gallery survive inside the parish room and the gallery appears to have its original bench seating with pipes for gas standards to the backs. Apart from this the former seating has been removed.

The chancel by Charles Edge originally had the Ten Commandments in black lettering to its East wall, but following the re-fitting as a Lady chapel in 1935 this is now covered by a reredos and panelling. The screen dividing this space from the body of the nave also appears to date from this period, or slightly earlier.

The nave and south aisle by Chatwin follow the module of Scoles' church, to the extent that the columns are placed at the same distance [and presumably use some of the earlier foundations]. The nave is divided into bays by colonettes and every two clerestory windows correspond to one arch of the nave arcade. The exception is at the eastern end, where the arcade arch at each side is a full two bays in width. The substantial roof has cusped wind braces and trusses with queen struts.

The fittings include an ashlar and alabaster font and matching pulpit, richly carved choir stalls and an organ with case designed by Chatwin and carved by Bridgeman which was placed in the lower stage of the unfinished tower. The stained glass is particularly good, with memorial windows by Kempe in the Lady chapel (Tree of Jesse), Heaton, Butler and Bayne, John Hardman and Burlison and Grylls. The floor is tiled to the body of the church and there are mosaic pavements in the chancel depicting the Evangelists and St. George...","false","false","false","true","false",24-JUN-11,25-JUN-11,25-JUN-11,,25,0,"1c4aae444f","http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5077/5870931422_4fa24cbf64_o.jpg","4fa24cbf64",4

moulded caps: high rusticated plinth, rusticated outer pilasters, eaves cornice; centre 3 bays enclosed by plain
pilasters with Tuscan caps carrying simple pediment above eaves course; 2-light mullioned and transomed windows, beaded
with architraves, rectangular-leaded with iron-framed opening lights having curl stays; to lower bay 3 a doorway, up 5
steps, with part-glazed panelled door, surround having attached Tuscan columns and entablature with segmental pediment;
in main upper pediment a circular attic window with iron-framed casements, scrolled decorative frame; and in roof
between bays 1 and 2 and 4 and 5 are 2-light dormer windows with pediments over; small 2-light basement windows in
plinth bays 2 and 4. South elevation, to street, has two prominent gables, each crowned by chimney stacks, and several
mullioned windows; north elevation has one gable, with 3-light hollow-chamfer mullioned window in recess above and
similar ovolo-mould window under label below, and in western section are four 12-pane sash windows with thick glazing
bars in nave mould recesses. Interior in two distinct halves, the east C17 and the west C17; two staircases, the older
in the south-east corner, has-carved oak 3-centre-arched overthrow in moulded frame at foot of stairs, the balusters
later; the second staircase in centre of east section is early C18, dog-leg pattern, with turned balusters and deep
moulded curved handrail, bottom step with very generous side curl, and fielded panelled dado to wall sides. Principal
rooms in western section; the centre room has timber cornice and fielded dado panelling, Keinton stone flag floor,
simple surround to fireplace, and on axis with outer door a doorway into the stair hall has an ornate fanlight. The
dining room in the south-west corner is similar in detail, with a shell-hood recess with shaped shelves in north wall.

Detached house. C17, reshaped early C18 and later. Ham stone ashlar; stone slate roofs between stepped coped gables;
stone chimney stacks. Double roof plan with additions. Two storeys with attics; east entrance elevation 5 bays, of
which bay 1 is a projecting gable. Continuous string to ground floor and eaves course; single-storey flat roofed
addition bays 2 and 3 probably early C20; hollow-chamfer mullioned windows; bay 1 has 3-light below, with moulded
cambered-arched door to right, and above a 5-light window, with 3-light to attic, all with labels; small blind window
in return at first floor level; bays 2 and 4 have 3-light windows, and bay 3 a 2-light transomed and mullioned, all
with labels; to lower bay 4 and a 5-light window with chamfered cambered-arched doorway to right; small square window
upper bay 5 and one blocked below; attic dormer window with flat roof between bays 2 and 3; in corner a stone water
cistern. West front, added c1720, also 5 bays but in classical style: this has hipped stone tile roof and chimneys with
moulded caps: high rusticated plinth, rusticated outer pilasters, eaves cornice; centre 3 bays enclosed by plain
pilasters with Tuscan caps carrying simple pediment above eaves course; 2-light mullioned and transomed windows, beaded
with architraves, rectangular-leaded with iron-framed opening lights having curl stays; to lower bay 3 a doorway, up 5
steps, with part-glazed panelled door, surround having attached Tuscan columns and entablature with segmental pediment;
in main upper pediment a circular attic window with iron-framed casements, scrolled decorative frame; and in roof
between bays 1 and 2 and 4 and 5 are 2-light dormer windows with pediments over; small 2-light basement windows in

mullioned windows; north elevation has one gable, with 3-light hollow-chamfer mullioned window in recess above and
similar ovolo-mould window under label below, and in western section are four 12-pane sash windows with thick glazing
bars in nave mould recesses. Interior in two distinct halves, the east C17 and the west C17; two staircases, the older
in the south-east corner, has-carved oak 3-centre-arched overthrow in moulded frame at foot of stairs, the balusters
later; the second staircase in centre of east section is early C18, dog-leg pattern, with turned balusters and deep
moulded curved handrail, bottom step with very generous side curl, and fielded panelled dado to wall sides. Principal
rooms in western section; the centre room has timber cornice and fielded dado panelling, Keinton stone flag floor,
simple surround to fireplace, and on axis with outer door a doorway into the stair hall has an ornate fanlight. The
dining room in the south-west corner is similar in detail, with a shell-hood recess with shaped shelves in north wall.
The north west corner drawing room fitted out c1740, with 'new' sash windows in north wall - here the cornice is more
elaborate, panelling is full height, with much use of egg-and dart decoration to panels and window openings, and the
fireplace surround, still restrained, is more elaborate in detail. First floor rooms not seen. A significant house in

A church, built in three distinct phases, to the designs of Joseph John Scoles (1836-8), Charles Edge (1855-7) and J.A.Chatwin (1884-5). The building is of sandstone with a slate roof. The ritual east end is oriented to the south-east compass point and directions in this description refer to ritual orientation. The two southern aisles formed part of the original church of 1836-8. To these a chancel, north-eastern vestry and clock tower were added in 1855-7 and in 1884-5 a larger nave and chancel were attached to the south side, replacing the former south aisle.

EXTERIOR: The original church designed by J.J.Scoles was relatively simple, with a nave and aisles under separate pitched roofs and no chancel. The north aisle has six bays of lancet windows, divided by buttresses, with a simple corbel table below the parapet. There is a door to the western end of the aisle and a gabled porch to the west end. An illustration of 1847 shows the west end to have a more-elaborate gable treatment with pinnacles and a rose window (perhaps blind) and it may be that these details were removed in the bomb damage of 1943. The Charles Edge chancel of 1855-7 continues the overall style of the Scoles building with lancets to the north and east sides and on the vestry. The octagonal clock tower is set in the re-entrant angle between the north aisle and the chancel. The Chatwin nave and chancel of 1884-5 continues this pattern of respectful adaptation and its south aisle reproduces the overall pattern of the north aisle, although it is lower, to accommodate a clerestory above, which has paired lights with cusped heads. The chancel has an eastern window of five lancet lights. To its south side is the lowest stage of a planned steeple which, together with its circular staircase turret, is capped by a temporary pitched roof.

INTERIOR: The Nave and north aisle of 1836-8 remain largely intact. The nave has a panelled ceiling with two circular, metal, ventilation grilles to the centre. The tall, slender columns which divide nave from aisle consist of clusters of colonettes with waterholding moulding to the base. The mouldings to the underside of the north gallery survive inside the parish room and the gallery appears to have its original bench seating with pipes for gas standards to the backs. Apart from this the former seating has been removed.

The chancel by Charles Edge originally had the Ten Commandments in black lettering to its East wall, but following the re-fitting as a Lady chapel in 1935 this is now covered by a reredos and panelling. The screen dividing this space from the body of the nave also appears to date from this period, or slightly earlier.

The nave and south aisle by Chatwin follow the module of Scoles' church, to the extent that the columns are placed at the same distance [and presumably use some of the earlier foundations]. The nave is divided into bays by colonettes and every two clerestory windows correspond to one arch of the nave arcade. The exception is at the eastern end, where the arcade arch at each side is a full two bays in width. The substantial roof has cusped wind braces and trusses with queen struts.

The fittings include an ashlar and alabaster font and matching pulpit, richly carved choir stalls and an organ with case designed by Chatwin and carved by Bridgeman which was placed in the lower stage of the unfinished tower. The stained glass is particularly good, with memorial windows by Kempe in the Lady chapel (Tree of Jesse), Heaton, Butler and Bayne, John Hardman and Burlison and Grylls.

It includes the The Town Hall, Coroner's Court, Former Sessions Court And Brooke Robinson Museum.

It is a Grade II* listed building, listed in 2010.

Also Known As:
THE TOWN HALL, CORONER'S COURT, FORMER SESSIONS COURT AND BROOKE ROBINSON MUSEUM
, ST JAMES'S ROAD
A group of civic buildings. The Town Hall, Coroner's Court, Museum Room and the former Magistrates' Court and Memorial Tower were designed by Harvey and Wicks and built between 1924 and 1928.

MATERIALS: The buildings are of red brick laid in English bond with blue brick diapering and ashlar dressings

PLAN: The building occupies a corner site with the Town Hall and Coroner's court facing south-west onto St. James's Road, and the Memorial Tower, which forms an entrance to the former Sessions court, facing south-east onto Priory Street. The Town Hall is connected to the library building on St. James's Road, which is separately listed (Grade II), and the former Sessions Court is connected to the Old Police Headquarters, which is also separately listed (Grade II) and faces Priory Street. The buildings are of two or three storeys.

EXTERIOR: The town hall building faces onto St. James's Road and has five bays, of which the central three are closely grouped. To the ground floor there are three central arches, approached by a flight of steps. These have four-centred arches and cable mouldings to the outer edge of their ashlar surrounds. The arches lead to a covered lobby and have wrought iron gates and grilles with the date '1928' to each surmount. At either side of these are set plain, two-light mullioned windows, lighting cloakrooms. To the first floor the tall windows are of two and three lights with mullions and transoms. The central window, of three lights, is fronted by a stone balcony supported on carved brackets and with barley-twist columns to the corners. The central plaque records the gift of the hall and the museum to the town by Brooke and Eugenia Robinson. To either side of the window are attached barley-twist columns which rise to stylised flame finials set at either side of an arched overthrow which has the coat of arms of Dudley to the tympanum in relief. Flanking this centrepiece are windows of 3x2 lights and to the far right and left are windows of 3x2 lights. The second floor walling is blank, but decorated with a lattice pattern of blue brick diapering. The combination of the first floor window balcony and overthrow and patterned upper brickwork is reminiscent of, and seems to be a conscious reference to, the Doge's Palace in Venice. To left of this facade, and linking the building to the library, is a single recessed bay which has a four-centred carriage arch to the street above which is a two-light mullioned window.

To the right of the Town Hall is a gabled block which houses the Coroner's court at ground floor level and the Brook Robinson Museum room at first floor level. This turns the corner between St. James's Road and Priory Street and has six bays facing St. James's Road, with four-centred doors to far right and left. The left-hand door is approached by a double flight of steps with a wrought iron hand rail and the door has an overthrow inscribed with the wording 'CORONERS COURT / BROOKE ROBINSON MUSEUM' and with carved shields and foliage to the spandrels. Windows to both floors are of two lights with mullions and a transom to the ground floor windows. The gabled front of this block faces onto Priory Street and has two-light mullioned windows to both floors. Between the first floor windows is set an inscribed tablet which records the opening of the building by Stanley Baldwin in October 1928.

There is a door to the western end of the aisle and a gabled porch to the west end. An illustration of 1847 shows the west end to have a more-elaborate gable treatment with pinnacles and a rose window (perhaps blind) and it may be that these details were removed in the bomb damage of 1943. The Charles Edge chancel of 1855-7 continues the overall style of the Scoles building with lancets to the north and east sides and on the vestry. The octagonal clock tower is set in the re-entrant angle between the north aisle and the chancel.

The chancel has an eastern window of five lancet lights. To its south side is the lowest stage of a planned steeple which, together with its circular staircase turret, is capped by a temporary pitched roof.

INTERIOR: The Nave and north aisle of 1836-8 remain largely intact. The nave has a panelled ceiling with two circular, metal, ventilation grilles to the centre. The tall, slender columns which divide nave from aisle consist of clusters of colonettes with waterholding moulding to the base. The mouldings to the underside of the north gallery survive inside the parish room and the gallery appears to have its original bench seating with pipes for gas standards to the backs. Apart from this the former seating has been removed.

The chancel by Charles Edge originally had the Ten Commandments in black lettering to its East wall, but following the re-fitting as a Lady chapel in 1935 this is now covered by a reredos and panelling. The screen dividing this space from the body of the nave also appears to date from this period, or slightly earlier.

The nave and south aisle by Chatwin follow the module of Scoles' church, to the extent that the columns are placed at the same distance [and presumably use some of the earlier foundations]. The nave is divided into bays by colonettes and every two clerestory windows correspond to one arch of the nave arcade. The exception is at the eastern end, where the arcade arch at each side is a full two bays in width. The substantial roof has cusped wind braces and trusses with queen struts.

The fittings include an ashlar and alabaster font and matching pulpit, richly carved choir stalls and an organ with case designed by Chatwin and carved by Bridgeman which was placed in the lower stage of the unfinished tower. The stained glass is particularly good, with memorial windows by Kempe in the Lady chapel (Tree of Jesse), Heaton, Butler and Bayne, John Hardman and Burlison and Grylls. The floor is tiled to the body of the church and there are mosaic pavements in the chancel depicting the Evangelists and St. George...","false","false","false","true","false",24-JUN-11,25-JUN-11,25-JUN-11,,27,0,"0dd6a51ef3","http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5149/5870940082_39df76d859_o.jpg","39df76d859",4

It includes the The Town Hall, Coroner's Court, Former Sessions Court And Brooke Robinson Museum.

It is a Grade II* listed building, listed in 2010.

Also Known As:
THE TOWN HALL, CORONER'S COURT, FORMER SESSIONS COURT AND BROOKE ROBINSON MUSEUM
, ST JAMES'S ROAD
A group of civic buildings. The Town Hall, Coroner's Court, Museum Room and the former Magistrates' Court and Memorial Tower were designed by Harvey and Wicks and built between 1924 and 1928.

MATERIALS: The buildings are of red brick laid in English bond with blue brick diapering and ashlar dressings

PLAN: The building occupies a corner site with the Town Hall and Coroner's court facing south-west onto St. James's Road, and the Memorial Tower, which forms an entrance to the former Sessions court, facing south-east onto Priory Street. The Town Hall is connected to the library building on St. James's Road, which is separately listed (Grade II), and the former Sessions Court is connected to the Old Police Headquarters, which is also separately listed (Grade II) and faces Priory Street. The buildings are of two or three storeys.

EXTERIOR: The town hall building faces onto St. James's Road and has five bays, of which the central three are closely grouped. To the ground floor there are three central arches, approached by a flight of steps. These have four-centred arches and cable mouldings to the outer edge of their ashlar surrounds. The arches lead to a covered lobby and have wrought iron gates and grilles with the date '1928' to each surmount. At either side of these are set plain, two-light mullioned windows, lighting cloakrooms. To the first floor the tall windows are of two and three lights with mullions and transoms. The central window, of three lights, is fronted by a stone balcony supported on carved brackets and with barley-twist columns to the corners. The central plaque records the gift of the hall and the museum to the town by Brooke and Eugenia Robinson. To either side of the window are attached barley-twist columns which rise to stylised flame finials set at either side of an arched overthrow which has the coat of arms of Dudley to the tympanum in relief. Flanking this centrepiece are windows of 3x2 lights and to the far right and left are windows of 3x2 lights. The second floor walling is blank, but decorated with a lattice pattern of blue brick diapering. The combination of the first floor window balcony and overthrow and patterned upper brickwork is reminiscent of, and seems to be a conscious reference to, the Doge's Palace in Venice. To left of this facade, and linking the building to the library, is a single recessed bay which has a four-centred carriage arch to the street above which is a two-light mullioned window.

To the right of the Town Hall is a gabled block which houses the Coroner's court at ground floor level and the Brook Robinson Museum room at first floor level. This turns the corner between St. James's Road and Priory Street and has six bays facing St. James's Road, with four-centred doors to far right and left. The left-hand door is approached by a double flight of steps with a wrought iron hand rail and the door has an overthrow inscribed with the wording 'CORONERS COURT / BROOKE ROBINSON MUSEUM' and with carved shields and foliage to the spandrels. Windows to both floors are of two lights with mullions and a transom to the ground floor windows. The gabled front of this block faces onto Priory Street and has two-light mullioned windows to both floors. Between the first floor windows is set an inscribed tablet which records the opening of the building by Stanley Baldwin in October 1928. Below this is the bronze RIBA plaque, awarded to the building in 1934.

<a href=""http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-217790-anglican-church-of-st-george-birmingham"" rel=""nofollow"">Anglican Church of St George - British Listed Buildings</a>

A church, built in three distinct phases, to the designs of Joseph John Scoles (1836-8), Charles Edge (1855-7) and J.A.Chatwin (1884-5). The building is of sandstone with a slate roof. The ritual east end is oriented to the south-east compass point and directions in this description refer to ritual orientation. The two southern aisles formed part of the original church of 1836-8. To these a chancel, north-eastern vestry and clock tower were added in 1855-7 and in 1884-5 a larger nave and chancel were attached to the south side, replacing the former south aisle.

EXTERIOR: The original church designed by J.J.Scoles was relatively simple, with a nave and aisles under separate pitched roofs and no chancel. The north aisle has six bays of lancet windows, divided by buttresses, with a simple corbel table below the parapet. There is a door to the western end of the aisle and a gabled porch to the west end. An illustration of 1847 shows the west end to have a more-elaborate gable treatment with pinnacles and a rose window (perhaps blind) and it may be that these details were removed in the bomb damage of 1943. The Charles Edge chancel of 1855-7 continues the overall style of the Scoles building with lancets to the north and east sides and on the vestry. The octagonal clock tower is set in the re-entrant angle between the north aisle and the chancel. The Chatwin nave and chancel of 1884-5 continues this pattern of respectful adaptation and its south aisle reproduces the overall pattern of the north aisle, although it is lower, to accommodate a clerestory above, which has paired lights with cusped heads. The chancel has an eastern window of five lancet lights. To its south side is the lowest stage of a planned steeple which, together with its circular staircase turret, is capped by a temporary pitched roof.

INTERIOR: The Nave and north aisle of 1836-8 remain largely intact. The nave has a panelled ceiling with two circular, metal, ventilation grilles to the centre. The tall, slender columns which divide nave from aisle consist of clusters of colonettes with waterholding moulding to the base. The mouldings to the underside of the north gallery survive inside the parish room and the gallery appears to have its original bench seating with pipes for gas standards to the backs. Apart from this the former seating has been removed.

The chancel by Charles Edge originally had the Ten Commandments in black lettering to its East wall, but following the re-fitting as a Lady chapel in 1935 this is now covered by a reredos and panelling. The screen dividing this space from the body of the nave also appears to date from this period, or slightly earlier.

The nave and south aisle by Chatwin follow the module of Scoles' church, to the extent that the columns are placed at the same distance [and presumably use some of the earlier foundations]. The nave is divided into bays by colonettes and every two clerestory windows correspond to one arch of the nave arcade. The exception is at the eastern end, where the arcade arch at each side is a full two bays in width. The substantial roof has cusped wind braces and trusses with queen struts.

The fittings include an ashlar and alabaster font and matching pulpit, richly carved choir stalls and an organ with case designed by Chatwin and carved by Bridgeman which was placed in the lower stage of the unfinished tower. The stained glass is particularly good, with memorial windows by Kempe in the Lady chapel (Tree of Jesse), Heaton, Butler and Bayne, John Hardman and Burlison and Grylls. The floor is tiled to the body of the church and there are mosaic pavements in the chancel depicting the Evangelists and St. George...","false","false","false","true","false",24-JUN-11,25-JUN-11,25-JUN-11,,25,0,"c773246a47","http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3010/5870385783_880cd99609_o.jpg","880cd99609",4

It includes the The Town Hall, Coroner's Court, Former Sessions Court And Brooke Robinson Museum.

It is a Grade II* listed building, listed in 2010.

Also Known As:
THE TOWN HALL, CORONER'S COURT, FORMER SESSIONS COURT AND BROOKE ROBINSON MUSEUM
, ST JAMES'S ROAD
A group of civic buildings. The Town Hall, Coroner's Court, Museum Room and the former Magistrates' Court and Memorial Tower were designed by Harvey and Wicks and built between 1924 and 1928.

MATERIALS: The buildings are of red brick laid in English bond with blue brick diapering and ashlar dressings

PLAN: The building occupies a corner site with the Town Hall and Coroner's court facing south-west onto St. James's Road, and the Memorial Tower, which forms an entrance to the former Sessions court, facing south-east onto Priory Street. The Town Hall is connected to the library building on St. James's Road, which is separately listed (Grade II), and the former Sessions Court is connected to the Old Police Headquarters, which is also separately listed (Grade II) and faces Priory Street. The buildings are of two or three storeys.

EXTERIOR: The town hall building faces onto St. James's Road and has five bays, of which the central three are closely grouped. To the ground floor there are three central arches, approached by a flight of steps. These have four-centred arches and cable mouldings to the outer edge of their ashlar surrounds. The arches lead to a covered lobby and have wrought iron gates and grilles with the date '1928' to each surmount. At either side of these are set plain, two-light mullioned windows, lighting cloakrooms. To the first floor the tall windows are of two and three lights with mullions and transoms. The central window, of three lights, is fronted by a stone balcony supported on carved brackets and with barley-twist columns to the corners. The central plaque records the gift of the hall and the museum to the town by Brooke and Eugenia Robinson. To either side of the window are attached barley-twist columns which rise to stylised flame finials set at either side of an arched overthrow which has the coat of arms of Dudley to the tympanum in relief. Flanking this centrepiece are windows of 3x2 lights and to the far right and left are windows of 3x2 lights. The second floor walling is blank, but decorated with a lattice pattern of blue brick diapering. The combination of the first floor window balcony and overthrow and patterned upper brickwork is reminiscent of, and seems to be a conscious reference to, the Doge's Palace in Venice. To left of this facade, and linking the building to the library, is a single recessed bay which has a four-centred carriage arch to the street above which is a two-light mullioned window.

To the right of the Town Hall is a gabled block which houses the Coroner's court at ground floor level and the Brook Robinson Museum room at first floor level. This turns the corner between St. James's Road and Priory Street and has six bays facing St. James's Road, with four-centred doors to far right and left. The left-hand door is approached by a double flight of steps with a wrought iron hand rail and the door has an overthrow inscribed with the wording 'CORONERS COURT / BROOKE ROBINSON MUSEUM' and with carved shields and foliage to the spandrels.

It includes the The Town Hall, Coroner's Court, Former Sessions Court And Brooke Robinson Museum.

It is a Grade II* listed building, listed in 2010.

Also Known As:
THE TOWN HALL, CORONER'S COURT, FORMER SESSIONS COURT AND BROOKE ROBINSON MUSEUM
, ST JAMES'S ROAD
A group of civic buildings. The Town Hall, Coroner's Court, Museum Room and the former Magistrates' Court and Memorial Tower were designed by Harvey and Wicks and built between 1924 and 1928.

MATERIALS: The buildings are of red brick laid in English bond with blue brick diapering and ashlar dressings

PLAN: The building occupies a corner site with the Town Hall and Coroner's court facing south-west onto St. James's Road, and the Memorial Tower, which forms an entrance to the former Sessions court, facing south-east onto Priory Street. The Town Hall is connected to the library building on St. James's Road, which is separately listed (Grade II), and the former Sessions Court is connected to the Old Police Headquarters, which is also separately listed (Grade II) and faces Priory Street. The buildings are of two or three storeys.

EXTERIOR: The town hall building faces onto St. James's Road and has five bays, of which the central three are closely grouped. To the ground floor there are three central arches, approached by a flight of steps. These have four-centred arches and cable mouldings to the outer edge of their ashlar surrounds. The arches lead to a covered lobby and have wrought iron gates and grilles with the date '1928' to each surmount. At either side of these are set plain, two-light mullioned windows, lighting cloakrooms. To the first floor the tall windows are of two and three lights with mullions and transoms. The central window, of three lights, is fronted by a stone balcony supported on carved brackets and with barley-twist columns to the corners. The central plaque records the gift of the hall and the museum to the town by Brooke and Eugenia Robinson. To either side of the window are attached barley-twist columns which rise to stylised flame finials set at either side of an arched overthrow which has the coat of arms of Dudley to the tympanum in relief. Flanking this centrepiece are windows of 3x2 lights and to the far right and left are windows of 3x2 lights. The second floor walling is blank, but decorated with a lattice pattern of blue brick diapering. The combination of the first floor window balcony and overthrow and patterned upper brickwork is reminiscent of, and seems to be a conscious reference to, the Doge's Palace in Venice. To left of this facade, and linking the building to the library, is a single recessed bay which has a four-centred carriage arch to the street above which is a two-light mullioned window.

To the right of the Town Hall is a gabled block which houses the Coroner's court at ground floor level and the Brook Robinson Museum room at first floor level. This turns the corner between St. James's Road and Priory Street and has six bays facing St. James's Road, with four-centred doors to far right and left. The left-hand door is approached by a double flight of steps with a wrought iron hand rail and the door has an overthrow inscribed with the wording 'CORONERS COURT / BROOKE ROBINSON MUSEUM' and with carved shields and foliage to the spandrels. Windows to both floors are of two lights with mullions and a transom to the ground floor windows.

It includes the The Town Hall, Coroner's Court, Former Sessions Court And Brooke Robinson Museum.

It is a Grade II* listed building, listed in 2010.

Also Known As:
THE TOWN HALL, CORONER'S COURT, FORMER SESSIONS COURT AND BROOKE ROBINSON MUSEUM
, ST JAMES'S ROAD
A group of civic buildings. The Town Hall, Coroner's Court, Museum Room and the former Magistrates' Court and Memorial Tower were designed by Harvey and Wicks and built between 1924 and 1928.

MATERIALS: The buildings are of red brick laid in English bond with blue brick diapering and ashlar dressings

PLAN: The building occupies a corner site with the Town Hall and Coroner's court facing south-west onto St. James's Road, and the Memorial Tower, which forms an entrance to the former Sessions court, facing south-east onto Priory Street. The Town Hall is connected to the library building on St. James's Road, which is separately listed (Grade II), and the former Sessions Court is connected to the Old Police Headquarters, which is also separately listed (Grade II) and faces Priory Street. The buildings are of two or three storeys.

EXTERIOR: The town hall building faces onto St. James's Road and has five bays, of which the central three are closely grouped. To the ground floor there are three central arches, approached by a flight of steps. These have four-centred arches and cable mouldings to the outer edge of their ashlar surrounds. The arches lead to a covered lobby and have wrought iron gates and grilles with the date '1928' to each surmount. At either side of these are set plain, two-light mullioned windows, lighting cloakrooms. To the first floor the tall windows are of two and three lights with mullions and transoms. The central window, of three lights, is fronted by a stone balcony supported on carved brackets and with barley-twist columns to the corners. The central plaque records the gift of the hall and the museum to the town by Brooke and Eugenia Robinson. To either side of the window are attached barley-twist columns which rise to stylised flame finials set at either side of an arched overthrow which has the coat of arms of Dudley to the tympanum in relief. Flanking this centrepiece are windows of 3x2 lights and to the far right and left are windows of 3x2 lights. The second floor walling is blank, but decorated with a lattice pattern of blue brick diapering. The combination of the first floor window balcony and overthrow and patterned upper brickwork is reminiscent of, and seems to be a conscious reference to, the Doge's Palace in Venice. To left of this facade, and linking the building to the library, is a single recessed bay which has a four-centred carriage arch to the street above which is a two-light mullioned window.

To the right of the Town Hall is a gabled block which houses the Coroner's court at ground floor level and the Brook Robinson Museum room at first floor level. This turns the corner between St. James's Road and Priory Street and has six bays facing St. James's Road, with four-centred doors to far right and left. The left-hand door is approached by a double flight of steps with a wrought iron hand rail and the door has an overthrow inscribed with the wording 'CORONERS COURT / BROOKE ROBINSON MUSEUM' and with carved shields and foliage to the spandrels. Windows to both floors are of two lights with mullions and a transom to the ground floor windows. The gabled front of this block faces onto Priory Street and has two-light mullioned windows to both floors. Between the first floor windows is set an inscribed tablet which records the opening of the building by Stanley Baldwin in October 1928. Below this is the bronze RIBA plaque, awarded to the building in 1934.

To the right of this and projecting is the Memorial Tower which has a stone plinth. The central doorway and the first floor window are combined within a stone surround to form a frontispiece which i...","false","false","false","true","false",04-JAN-11,22-FEB-12,05-JAN-11,,25,0,"ddf8d1bf98","http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5166/5328558650_7a88d57606_o.jpg","7a88d57606",4

It is a former Cold Storage building from 1899 by Ernest C Bewlay.

It is a Grade II listed building.

Ice Factory and Cold Store. Designed in 1899 by Ernest Bewlay for the Linde British Refrigeration Company and completed in 1900, by which time Bewlay had joined Cossins and Peacock of Colmore Row. Red brick with a slate roof. Four storeys and a basement.
Exterior: The front to Digbeth Road has a distinct architectural treatment. There are 10 bays: At ground floor level these have semi-circular relieving arches and the 7 bays at left are blind but at right the 3 metal-framed windows have cambered heads. The first floor is blind, but the second and third floor windows are paired and the third floor has lunettes, save to the 2 right-hand bays which are blind. The left flank abuts No. 135 Digbeth. The right flank has 2 shaped gables with a loading bay to the ground floor which has a raised platform and 4 iron columns with bollards. The second and third floors here have a wall arcade but no windows. To the tops of the gables are large circular air inlets. A wall to ground floor level at right has been demolished and the 1937 Goad Insurance plan of the site indicates that this is probably where the boilerhouse chimney once stood. The rear has the boilerhouse at right with arched heads to the metal-framed windows and pilaster buttresses and a louvre to the roof.
Interior: the building has a tall ground floor and lesser height to the three upper floors. The loading bay is at the eastern end of the building, giving onto a courtyard which is entered from Digbeth and Orwell Passage. Immediately behind are a staircase and two lifts leading to each floor. The floors are supported by a grid of evenly spaced iron columns with moulded caps supporting steel beams. At each level there are 4 main chambers. These have heavy, insulated doors and the walls and ceiling are lined with wood panelling behind which is cork insulation. There are metal ducts of rectangular section across the ceilings, which are also covered with cork insulation and boxed-in with wood panels. To the top of the building there are replaced fans which circulate cold air. The roof structure has been replaced to the original pattern.
Opposite the loading bay, on the other side of a courtyard, is a lower building with shaped gables housing the office, stores and canteen, built in 1920 to designs by Cossins, Peacock and Cooke, which is not included in this item.

Here, the jacket supporting the main production platform undergoes a complete replacement, down to the splash zone.

Huge volumes of scaffold are required as the task is not considered safe for Rope Access work, due to the potential for injury in handling high-pressure water jetting guns and grit blasting.

The work site is very exposed to the elements and the scaffolding can only be completed at low tide. Likewise, work at the lower levels must be completed between the tides and in daylight. The noise from the blasting gun and water jetting is horrendous. Add to that the requirement to wear heavy personal protective equipment and the physical nature of the work, this is work at the extreme limit of endurance.

Regular changeout of personnel for the more arduous tasks is imperitive. This is not a job for anyone not 100% fit and focussed. This jacket alone will take two month to complete.

Hay muy poquitas representaciones de mujeres en la Antigua Grecia haciendo deporte, entre otras cosas, porque no participaban en ninguno de los juegos panhelénicos. Pero sí tenemos noticias de que las mujeres griegas competían en una carrera pedestre en honor de Hera en el santuario de Olimpia. Pausanias (5.16.2-3): “Cada cuatro años tejen a Hera un peplo las 16 mujeres y ellas mismas convocan una competición, los Juegos Hereos. La competición consiste en una carrera para muchachas, no todas de la misma edad, sino que corren las primeras las más jóvenes y después de ellas las segundas en edad y las últimas las muchachas que son mayores. Y corren de la siguiente manera: llevan suelto el cabello y una túnica les llega un poco por encima de la rodilla y enseñan el hombro derecho hasta el pecho. También a ellas les está asignado para la competición el estadio olímpico, pero se les reduce para la carrera aproximadamente la sexta parte de él. A las vencedoras les conceden coronas de olivo y parte de la vaca sacrificada a Hera, y además les está permitido ofrendar imágenes con inscripciones. Y también hay mujeres que prestan ayuda a las 16 que dirigen estas competiciones. Estos juegos de muchachas los hacen remontar también a una época antigua, diciéndose que Hipodamía, para dar gracias a Hera por su boda con Pélope, reunió a las 16 mujeres y con ellas fue la primera en organizar los Juegos Hereos”.

Greek
Parian marble

H. 31 1/2 in. (80 cm)
Fletcher Fund, 1927 (27.45)

Grave stelai, like this one, would have been erected in Greek cemeteries in memory of the deceased. On this particular relief, a little girl, standing in profile, bows her head with a seriousness unusual in someone so young; her face is serene and strong. The child wears a peplos, a simple woolen garment folded over at the top and fastened at the shoulders. The unsewn edges fall open in a cascade of folds along her right side. Smooth against her legs, the fabric clarifies the pose of the body beneath it. The gentle gravity of the child is beautifully expressed through her sweet farewell to her pet doves. She holds one bird affectionately close, and it seems to nestle up to her; the other perches on her left hand. Children often appear with their pets on Classical grave reliefs, and these doves must be the little girl's favorites.

The stele was found in 1775 on the Greek island of Paros, one of the Cycladic Islands in the Aegean Sea. Many of the most skillful stone carvers in antiquity came from the Cycladic Islands, where marble was plentiful. Parian marble was highly prized in antiquity, and is still considered one of the finest marbles for carving sculpture. The restrained beauty of this figure brings to mind the youths carved on the frieze that encircles the outer walls of the Parthenon, one of the many buildings erected on the Athenian Akropolis in the mid-fifth century B.C. under the Greek statesman Perikles. Many artists came to Athens at that time for employment and the sculptor of this grave monument could well have been among them.","false","false","false","true","false",12-NOV-09,15-NOV-11,12-MAR-10,,16,0,"4babd4dc28","","",4

---------------------------------
1540 war in Paris die neue lateinische Übersetzung der Nikomachischen Ethik des Aristoteles aus der Feder des französischen Benediktiners und Philologen <b>Joachim Périon</b> erschienen, 1542 (GG 126) vollständig, 1545, 1552 und 1555 in Basel ohne Beigaben nachgedruckt worden. 1541 erschien in Venedig eine <b>weitere neue lateinische Übersetzung</b>, vereint mit der Übersetzung byzantinischer Kommentare (nach der <b>griechischen Ausgabe von Venedig 1536</b>), aus der Feder des Venezianer Benediktiners Giovanni Bernardino Feliciano, Kardinal Alessandro Farnese gewidmet; auch sie wurde sogleich in Basel nachgedruckt, wohl von Oporin um 1542. Nochmals eine neue Übersetzung - neben weiteren - die in Basel Folgen zeitigte, erschien 1558 in Venedig, aus der Feder des bekannten französischen Philologen Denis Lambin. Lambin (Montreuil-sur-Mer 1520 - Paris 1572 infolge der Geschehnisse der Bartholomäusnacht), weilte nach Studien in Amiens längere Zeit in Italien und wurde 1561 Professor am Collège de France in Paris. Dieses Werk gibt hier der Basler Philosoph und Arzt Theodor Zwinger in neuer Bearbeitung nochmals heraus, nachdem es 1565 auch noch in Paris erschienen war. Zwinger (1533-1588) war, nach Studien in Basel, Paris und Padua (Medizin) gerade 1565 in Basel Professor der griechischen Sprache geworden (1571 dann Professor für Ethik, 1580 für theoretische Medizin). Mit eingearbeitet hat Zwinger, wie auch die wieder abgedruckten Vorreden zeigen, auch den Kommentar zum 5. Buch der Nikomachischen Ethik von Marc Antoine Muret (Muret 1526 - Rom 1585), einem ebenfalls bedeutenden französischen Philologen, der in Poitiers, Bordeaux, Paris und Toulouse lehrte, seit 1554 in Venedig und Padua, 1563 dann in Rom, wo er 1576 Priester wurde. Zwinger hat Übersetzung und Kommentar (Annotationes) des mit ihm wohl von seinem Pariser oder Paduaner Studium her befreundeten Lambinus für seine Ausgabe durch den griechischen Text ergänzt, begründet das in seiner Widmung an Lambin aus Basel vom 1. September 1566; weiter hat er den meist recht umfangreichen Annotationes des Lambinus in der Widmung als gering bezeichnete Scholien als zweiten Kommentar beigegeben, die in Wirklichkeit oft ausführlicher als die Lambins sind. Schliesslich hat er den Text übersichtlicher gegliedert, erwähnt in seiner Widmung auch Tafeln, die den Aufbau des Werkes zeigen sollten und die auch im Titel erwähnt werden, welche wie die beiden Basler die meisten Exemplare nicht mehr enthalten, und hat dem Werk des Aristoteles, da dieser sich häufig auf Pythagoreisches berufe, Fragmente des Pythagoras aus der Antholog...","false","false","false","true","false",17-NOV-10,08-MAY-12,25-OCT-10,,12,0,"6aa38ba8bf","http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1100/5114616335_cdfebaaa42_o.jpg","cdfebaaa42",4

<b>CARE Fair readies Baumholder community for deployment</b>

Oct 1, 2010

By Ignacio Rubalcava (USAG Baumholder)

BAUMHOLDER, Germany - More than 1,000 Soldiers and family members made their way from booth to booth at the annual CARE Fair Sept. 11 and gathered information needed to prepare for the upcoming deployment of the 170th Infantry Brigade Combat Team.
 
U.S. Army Garrison Baumholder agencies and several other facilities such as the Health and Dental Clinics, post exchange, commissary and many more set up temporary offices in the Hall of Champions to provide the community a one-stop shopping opportunity for all their official and personal needs.
 
Agencies participating provided a comprehensive representation of the community, including the city of Baumholder, represented by Michael Roehrig, assistant city mayor of Baumholder; AWAG, represented by European Chairperson Lorinda Risley; the 170th IBCT, the Baumholder School Behavioral Health and more. In all, 36 agencies were represented. 
 
&quot;It was a very successful event,&quot; said Catherine Dubosc, event coordinator. 
 
&quot;The focus of the fair this year was to prepare Soldiers and families for upcoming deployments,&quot; said Dubosc. 
 
All participating agencies were handing out information related to preparing for deployment such as wills and power of attorneys from the legal office and child care benefits during deployment by Child, Youth and School Services.
 
Because the focus was on deployment, the 170th Infantry Brigade Combat Team played a key role in this year's CARE Fair. 
 
Booths sponsored by the 170th IBCT distributed Military One Source related information and battalion and company level specific Family Readiness Group information. This included contact information for family readiness support assistants, family readiness liaisons and family readiness group leaders. FRG groups had activity and meeting information on hand. 
 
Members of the 170th IBCT also registered visitors for their virtual FRG and also took sign-ups for FRG specific activities. The virtual FRG is a secure source used to communicate command information to the families when the Soldiers are downrange. Single Soldiers can sign up family and friends that they would like to give this information too.
 
Jennifer Joyce from the Baumholder Community Spouses Club provided information about the organization, its benefits, upcoming social events and registered new members.
 
The housing office provided copies of the sample exception to policy memo and the point of contact memo for retaining quarters during deployment. They also introduced customers to the Army Housing Referral Network, the new housing referral automated system.
 
Also in line with deployment, the Directorate of Logistics provided information about privately owned vehicle storage during deployment.
 
The new neighborhood watch program, IWATCH, was introduced by Laney Rich from the USAG Baumholder force protection office. He also provided information about National Preparedness Month and distributed information about emergency preparedness.

NASA Selects Science Investigations for Solar Probe Plus

NASA has begun development of a mission to visit and study the sun closer than ever before. The unprecedented project, named Solar Probe Plus, is slated to launch no later than 2018.

The small car-sized spacecraft will plunge directly into the sun's atmosphere approximately four million miles from our star's surface. It will explore a region no other spacecraft ever has encountered. NASA has selected five science investigations that will unlock the sun's biggest mysteries.

&quot;The experiments selected for Solar Probe Plus are specifically designed to solve two key questions of solar physics -- why is the sun's outer atmosphere so much hotter than the sun's visible surface and what propels the solar wind that affects Earth and our solar system? &quot; said Dick Fisher, director of NASA's Heliophysics Division in Washington. &quot;We've been struggling with these questions for decades and this mission should finally provide those answers.&quot;

As the spacecraft approaches the sun, its revolutionary carbon-composite heat shield must withstand temperatures exceeding 2550 degrees Fahrenheit and blasts of intense radiation. The spacecraft will have an up close and personal view of the sun enabling scientists to better understand, characterize and forecast the radiation environment for future space explorers.

NASA invited researchers in 2009 to submit science proposals. Thirteen were reviewed by a panel of NASA and outside scientists. The total dollar amount for the five selected investigations is approximately $180 million for preliminary analysis, design, development and tests.

Buffalo is a brand of clothing and accessories, perhaps best known for its footwear. Its headquarters are in Hochheim am Main, Germany.

Buffalo's notoriety increased significantly with the popularity, especially in Europe, of its platform shoes from the mid 1990s through the early 2000s. The 10-centimetre platform model 1310-2 was made famous by British girl band Spice Girls and in the 2000s by boy-band McFly.

Buffalo manufactures Damenschuhe (Shoes for Female), Herrenschuhe like dress shoes, western and biker boots, skate shoes, high heels, pumps, Sandalen, Overknee Stiefel, flip-flops, and other footwear, as well as shirts, jackets, trousers, skirts, hosiery, swimsuits, undergarments, and small baggage.

Certain Buffalo articles are a sexual fetish.

Ugg boots (sometimes called uggs) are unisex sheepskin boots, made of twin-faced sheepskin with fleece on the inside and with a tanned outer surface, often with a synthetic sole. Ugg boots are believed to have been first developed in New Zealand or Australia although the exact date is uncertain.

There has been a dispute between manufacturers of ugg boots, as to whether &quot;ugg&quot; is a generic term and thus ineligible for trademark protection, especially in the region of origin. Deckers Outdoor Corporation holds the UGG trademark in more than 100 countries worldwide. Notable exceptions are Australia and New Zealand where the term is considered generic.

<u>Jimmy Choo:</u>

Dato' Jimmy Choo OBE, born Jimmy Choo Yeang Keat, (Chinese: 周仰杰)  is a Malaysian fashion designer based in London, United Kingdom. He is best known for founding Jimmy Choo Ltd that became known for its hand-made women's shoes.

Choo was born in Penang, Malaysia into a family of shoemakers. He is of Chinese Hakka descent. He made his first shoe when he was 11 years old. He is perhaps the most notable of students of Cordwainers Technical College in Hackney from which he graduated in 1983. (The college is now part of the London College of Fashion.) Choo has divulged that he worked part-time at restaurants and as a cleaner at a shoe factory to help fund his college education.

Jimmy Choo's beginnings can be traced back to his workshop in Hackney, North London, which he opened in 1986 by renting an old hospital building. His craftsmanship and designs were soon noticed and he came to the verge of international notability when his creations were featured in a record eight pages in a 1988 issue of Vogue magazine. Patronage from Diana, Princess of Wales from 1990 onwards further boosted his image.

Platform shoes (also known as Disco Boots) are shoes, boots, or sandals with thick soles at least four inches in height, often made of cork, plastic, rubber, or wood (wooden-soled platform shoes are technically also clogs). They have been worn in various cultures since ancient times for fashion or for added height.

Platform shoes took off in a very big way amongst most age groups and classes of UK men and women in the 1970s.

High-heeled footwear (often abbreviated as high heels or simply heels) is footwear that raises the heel of the wearer's foot significantly higher than the toes. When both the heel and the toes are raised equal amounts, as in a platform shoe, it is technically not considered to be a &quot;high-heel&quot;; however, there are also high-heeled platform shoes. High heels tend to give the aesthetic illusion of longer, more slender and more toned legs. High-heels come in a wide variety of styles, and the heels are found in many different shapes, including stiletto, pump (court shoe), block, tapered, blade, and wedge.

According to high fashion shoe websites like Jimmy Choo and Gucci, a &quot;low heel&quot; is considered less than 2.5 inches) (6 centimeters), while heels between 2.5 and 3.5 inches (8.5 cm) are considered &quot;mid heels,&quot; and anything over that is considered a &quot;high heel&quot;[citation needed].

Gradually, the M-Class became a sales success in the United States and Mexico. In terms of size, it is slotted in between the smaller GLK-Class (based on the C-Class) and the larger GL-Class, with which it shares platforms. For a short time, between the years 1999 to 2002, the M class was also built by Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria, for the European market, until it moved to part of the U.S. market.

=====

The Mercedes-Benz W163 M-Class SUV was introduced in 1997 for the 1998 model year. It is a midsized body-on-frame suv with seating for 5 or 7 with an optional third-row seat. The M-Class was the first luxury SUV to feature stability control, a system designed to detect loss of control and instantaneously intervene with selective braking to bring the vehicle back on its intended course. This system is now hailed by safety experts, and studies have shown stability control and systems like it are capable of reducing single vehicle crashes by up to 30 percent. Furthermore, the M-Class boasted front- and side-impact airbags with advanced occupant detection for the front passenger seat, which, combined with Mercedes' legendary safety structure, earned the M-Class the highest marks in insurance industry crash tests.

Platform shoes (also known as Disco Boots) are shoes, boots, or sandals with thick soles at least four inches in height, often made of cork, plastic, rubber, or wood (wooden-soled platform shoes are technically also clogs). They have been worn in various cultures since ancient times for fashion or for added height.

Platform shoes took off in a very big way amongst most age groups and classes of UK men and women in the 1970s. Whilst wedge heels were popular on platforms in the summer, high thick separate heeled platform boots and shoes were 'all the rage'. Many of the shoe styles were recycled 1940s and early 1950s styles, but both shoes and boots were often in garish combinations of bright colours.

The trend firmly re-established itself in the Developed World fashions of the late 1990s and very early 21st century with a much higher threshold of what was considered outrageous: mothers and fathers of 1997 to 2004 typically think nothing of buying their preschool-age daughters and sons platform sandals that US parents of 1973 would not have wanted their high-school-age daughters and sons wearing and UK parents of 1973 would not have wanted their prepubescent daughters and sons wearing, and the Walt Disney Company has licensed Mickey Mouse cutouts and &quot;Disney Princess&quot; and &quot;Action Man&quot; images on footwear that in earlier decades would have been considered totally inappropriate for the company's &quot;wholesome&quot; image.

Buffalo Boots is a brand which platform models were popular, especially in Europe (notably Germany and Scandinavia), from the mid 1990s to the early 2000s.

(Unfortunately, since the ground-level supports have a way of snapping during earthquakes.) Today, we think of these as eyesores and grieve over the mansions that disappeared in their wake, but they are a peculiar reminder of the very different society that was postwar America. These cheap concrete frame and picture-window constructions sprouted in many lakefront neighborhoods, especially Lakeview and Edgewater, as three factors collided: 
 
(1) a pent-up demand for studio apartments, which became fashionable as changing social norms made it acceptable for young men and women to live on their own, as residential hotels and rooming-houses became socially unacceptable, and as the baby boom created an unprecedented number of new households after a twenty-year construction drought. Today, studios have fallen out of fashion among singles who prefer the spaciousness of 1-BRs that would have fit entire families back in the day.
 
(2) cheap new construction materials and techniques, particularly reinforced concrete, air conditioning, and aluminum window frames, arriving at the same time that architectural modernism permeated the public imagination.
 
(3) the permissive new 1957 zoning ordinance, which projected that Chicago would grow to five million residents (from its already overcrowded 1960 peak of almost four million) and would require many new residences -- especially along the perpetually popular lakefront, which would be served by a new subway line. Their boundless optimism crashed and burned in the 1970s-1980s; instead of growing, the city's population plummeted by over a million, none of the new subway lines 
envisioned ever materialized, and much of the city's economic might trickled out to the suburbs or gushed to the Sunbelt, the Third World, and to super-dominant global cities. 
 
In 1967, the City Council amended the zoning ordinance to ban all-studio buildings and construction of the 4 plus 1 ceased almost overnight. 
 
This particular 4 plus 1 occupies a site near a quiet corner miles and miles from any of its sisters. Guessing the neighborhood will be easy, so I'll up the ante and ask: of the city's countless Starbuckses, which one is this nearest?","false","false","false","true","false",29-OCT-05,14-SEP-08,30-OCT-05,,3,6,"ff5d470c22","http://farm1.static.flickr.com/33/57346263_ff5d470c22_o.jpg","ff5d470c22",4

NASA Selects Science Investigations for Solar Probe Plus

NASA has begun development of a mission to visit and study the sun closer than ever before. The unprecedented project, named Solar Probe Plus, is slated to launch no later than 2018.

The small car-sized spacecraft will plunge directly into the sun's atmosphere approximately four million miles from our star's surface. It will explore a region no other spacecraft ever has encountered. NASA has selected five science investigations that will unlock the sun's biggest mysteries.

&quot;The experiments selected for Solar Probe Plus are specifically designed to solve two key questions of solar physics -- why is the sun's outer atmosphere so much hotter than the sun's visible surface and what propels the solar wind that affects Earth and our solar system? &quot; said Dick Fisher, director of NASA's Heliophysics Division in Washington. &quot;We've been struggling with these questions for decades and this mission should finally provide those answers.&quot;

As the spacecraft approaches the sun, its revolutionary carbon-composite heat shield must withstand temperatures exceeding 2550 degrees Fahrenheit and blasts of intense radiation. The spacecraft will have an up close and personal view of the sun enabling scientists to better understand, characterize and forecast the radiation environment for future space explorers.

NASA invited researchers in 2009 to submit science proposals. Thirteen were reviewed by a panel of NASA and outside scientists. The total dollar amount for the five selected investigations is approximately $180 million for preliminary analysis, design, development and tests.

Amazing things I didnt even remember picking up, work related do-dads and thingamys, various denominations of currency, and an ever growing lint farm to name a few.
Today I found an entire galaxy in there.
...
Better remember to take it out before I do the laundry.

<b>Strobist Info</b>:
SB28 behind camera right, Diffused with Bubblewrap for fill light. Triggered by V2 trigger. Power @ 1/16.
YN460 in my pocket. set to optical slave. 1/16 power. Aqua gel.

I needed to use the slave on this one since the overall size of a YN460 with a v2 trigger hanging off it is much larger than even my biggest pocket. 

Even still, I had to rejecet a number of shots in this set because the angle of the shot combined with the huge bulge in my pocket made it appear as if i were gazing at my glowing crotch. Funny! but not the intended result.","false","false","false","true","false",12-MAY-10,06-JUN-10,13-MAY-10,,20,3,"8f7c86318c","http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1414/4603396526_25c1efca5f_o.jpg","25c1efca5f",4

The Dublin Council Building, Wood Quay, Dublin, Rep. of Ireland  [ Built 1994 ]

This development was the final part of a controversial development lasting over twenty years. The site at Wood Quay had been earmarked as a site for the headquarters of Dublin Corporation since the 1950s. Many schemes had already been proposed including this when a competition was held in 1968. After the judging process was carried out, the winner was the design by Sam Stephenson. 

This consisted of four monumental granite clad blocks linked by a glass atrium. The two block at the rear of the site were to be taller allowing the building to descend towards the river. However after construction began, the remains of the viking city were found preserved beneath the site as well as a long section of the medieval city walls. This was to be the most important find on the viking beginnings of Dublin was one of the most important viking sites anywhere in Europe.

After a period of some years, court cases, site invasions, excavations of the site and much publicity, the corporation finally began to built the development. Their nerve did not hold and after phase I was completed, the remainder of the project was put on hold – never to be completed. The ground around the two blocks were landscaped and the remains of the city wall piled up in a basement.

In the late 1980s the corporation held another competition to finish the site and to place a building along the quay completing the streetscape. This time the competition was won by Scott Tallon Walker and was completed in 1994. In the original competition Michael Scott had been a runner up with a scaled down version of the United Nations building in New York complete with plaza, podium and 14 story glass sided block.

Mike Garry was at the book and art market in St Anne's Square today and was kind enough to pause for a moment so I could take his photo. He's recently won a Manchester photography competition with the photograph he's holding, of the graffiti of his own poem. Now I've got a photograph of the poet holding a photograph of a stencil from his poem. 

I should have bought a Gorton Girls t-shirt, but I was saving cash to spend at Earth Cafe later and my stomach was rumbling so it won the vote. We did buy a book of his poems, called Mancunian Meander, which is worth a read.
