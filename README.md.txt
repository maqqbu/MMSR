This repository contains code for our NeurIPS 2020 paper: Adversarial Crowdsourcing Through Robust Rank-One Matrix Completion.


## Introduction
We consider the problem of reconstructing a rank-one matrix from a revealed subsetof its entries when some of the revealed entries are corrupted with perturbations thatare unknown and can be arbitrarily large. It is not known which revealed entries arecorrupted. We propose a new algorithm combining alternating minimization withextreme-value filtering and provide sufficient and necessary conditions to recoverthe original rank-one matrix. In particular, we show that our proposed algorithm isoptimal when the set of revealed entries is given by an Erdős-Rényi random graph.

These results are then applied to the problem of classification from crowdsourceddata under the assumption that while the majority of the workers are governed bythe standard single-coin David-Skene model (i.e., they output the correct answerwith a certain probability), some of the workers can deviate arbitrarily from thismodel. In particular, the “adversarial” workers could even make decisions designedto make the algorithm output an incorrect answer. Extensive experimental resultsshow our algorithm for this problem, based on rank-one matrix completion withperturbations, outperforms all other state-of-the-art methods in such an adversarialscenario.
